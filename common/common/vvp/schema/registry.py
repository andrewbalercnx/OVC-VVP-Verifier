"""ACDC Schema SAID Registry.

Credentials must use recognized schema SAIDs from the vLEI governance
framework. This module provides a versioned registry of known schema SAIDs
for validation.

This module is shared between verifier and issuer services.

Registry Version: 1.3.0
Last Updated: 2026-02-03

Normative Source: https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI/tree/main/schema/acdc

vLEI Credential Chain Hierarchy:
================================
GLEIF (Root AID)
    └── QVI Credential (issued to Qualified vLEI Issuers like Provenant)
            └── LE Credential (issued to Legal Entities)
                    ├── OOR Auth → OOR (Official Organizational Role)
                    └── ECR Auth → ECR (Engagement Context Role)

Edge Structure:
- LE credentials have `e.qvi` edge pointing to QVI credential SAID
- OOR Auth/ECR Auth have `e.le` edge pointing to LE credential SAID
- OOR has `e.auth` edge pointing to OOR Auth credential SAID
- ECR has `e.auth` or `e.le` edge
