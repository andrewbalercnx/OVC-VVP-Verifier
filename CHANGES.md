# VVP Verifier Change Log

## Sprint 54: Open-Source Standalone VVP Verifier

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Complete

### Summary

Extracted the VVP verification logic into a standalone, self-contained open-source repository on the `vvp-verifier` orphan branch. The standalone verifier implements a 9-phase verification pipeline with dual SIP/HTTP interfaces, two-tier caching, and background revocation checking.

Key deliverables:
- 41 files, ~11,400 lines on `vvp-verifier` orphan branch
- 81 tests passing (header, passport, SIP, cache, pipeline, error propagation)
- 9-phase pipeline: Parse Identity → Parse PASSporT → Bind → Verify Ed25519 → Fetch Dossier → Validate DAG → Verify ACDC Chain → Check Revocation → Validate Authorization
- SIP UDP interface (INVITE → 302 redirect with X-VVP-* headers)
- FastAPI HTTP API (POST /verify, GET /healthz, GET / web UI)
- Two-tier caching (verification result + dossier, LRU+TTL, config-fingerprinted)
- Background revocation checker (async worker, queue dedup, REVOKED sticky)
- Mandatory capabilities dict for subset compliance signaling (§4.2A)
- MIT License (Rich Connexions Ltd)

### Branch

`vvp-verifier` (orphan branch, no monorepo history)

Commits:
- `0bc4347` Initial release: standalone VVP Verifier
- `8509c3a` Fix code review findings: broken imports, DAG error propagation, add tests

## Sprint 48 (addendum): Full SIP Call Flow Event Capture

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** Implementation complete, pending code review

### Summary

Extended the SIP Monitor dashboard to capture all 4 stages of a VVP call flow (signing request, signing response, verification request, verification response). Previously only the signing INVITE request headers were captured.

Key changes:
- Added `response_vvp_headers` field to `SIPEvent` dataclass for storing response VVP headers
- Updated signing handler to pass `SIPResponse` to `_capture_event` for response header extraction
- Added `POST /api/events/ingest` endpoint (localhost-only) for cross-process event ingestion
- Added event capture to the verification handler via HTTP POST to the monitor
- Updated dashboard UI: renamed "VVP Headers" tab to "Request VVP", added "Response VVP" tab
- Status badge now prefers `response_vvp_headers["X-VVP-Status"]` (definitive) over request headers

### Files Modified

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `services/sip-redirect/app/monitor/buffer.py` | Added `response_vvp_headers: dict` to SIPEvent, default in `add()` |
| `services/sip-redirect/app/redirect/handler.py` | Added `response` param to `_capture_event`, extract response VVP headers |
| `services/sip-redirect/app/monitor/server.py` | Added `POST /api/events/ingest` handler with loopback enforcement |
| `services/sip-redirect/app/monitor_web/index.html` | Renamed "VVP Headers" to "Request VVP", added "Response VVP" tab |
| `services/sip-redirect/app/monitor_web/sip-monitor.js` | Added `renderResponseVvpTab`, updated status badge logic |
| `services/sip-verify/app/config.py` | Added `VVP_MONITOR_URL`, `VVP_MONITOR_ENABLED`, `VVP_MONITOR_TIMEOUT` |
| `services/sip-verify/app/verify/handler.py` | Added `_capture_event()` with HTTP POST to monitor ingestion endpoint |

### Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `services/sip-redirect/tests/test_monitor_buffer.py` | 5 tests for response_vvp_headers in buffer |
| `services/sip-redirect/tests/test_monitor_ingest.py` | 6 tests for ingestion endpoint |

## Sprint 53: E2E System Validation & Cache Timing

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** APPROVED (Pair Review — 6 plan revisions, 1 code review round)

### Summary

Validated the full VVP system health check and SIP call test scripts against production. Added timing instrumentation (`--timing`, `--timing-count`, `--timing-threshold`, `--test chain`) to measure cache effectiveness via chained sign→verify mode. Fixed a pre-existing bug in SIP redirect that silently dropped P-VVP-Identity and P-VVP-Passport headers. Created a bootstrap script for complete issuer asset provisioning after LMDB/Postgres recovery.

### Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scripts/bootstrap-issuer.py` | 5-step bootstrap: reinit mock vLEI → create org → API key → TN allocation → TN mapping |
| `scripts/test_sip_call_test.py` | 21 CLI regression tests for timing flags, chain mode, JSON schema |

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/sip-call-test.py` | Added `--timing`, `--timing-count`, `--timing-threshold`, `--timing-delay`, `--test chain`, `--verifier-url`, cache metrics snapshot, chained sign→verify timing |
| `scripts/system-health-check.sh` | Added `--timing` flag, `_run_timing_tests()` for Phase 4, timing in JSON output |
| `services/issuer/app/api/admin.py` | Added `POST /admin/mock-vlei/reinitialize` — clears 6 tables, resets singleton, re-initializes infrastructure |
| `services/sip-redirect/app/redirect/client.py` | Fixed VVP header field names: `vvp_identity` → `vvp_identity_header`, `passport` → `passport_jwt` |
| `services/pbx/config/public-sip.xml` | Updated loopback dialplan API key to match bootstrapped org key |
| `services/issuer/config/api_keys.json` | Updated dev-admin key hash |

### Key Results

- **Sign test:** 302 VALID with P-VVP-Identity, P-VVP-Passport, P-VVP-Brand-Name headers
- **Verify test:** Verifier responds to SIP verification requests
- **Chain timing:** 3.0x speedup (cold=42ms, cached=14ms)
- **Issuer unit tests:** 422 tests pass
- **CLI regression tests:** 21 tests pass

### Bug Fix: SIP Redirect VVP Header Extraction

The sip-redirect client extracted `data.get("vvp_identity")` and `data.get("passport")` from the issuer `/vvp/create` response, but the issuer returns `vvp_identity_header` and `passport_jwt`. This caused P-VVP-Identity and P-VVP-Passport headers to be silently `None` in all 302 redirect responses.

### Additional Files Modified (Post-Archival Fixes)

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Combined deploy+restart into single `az vm run-command` to avoid serialization conflict; changed version verification from external curl to `az vm run-command` with `localhost:8085`; added 15s sleep before verification |
| `scripts/system-health-check.sh` | Fixed SIP-Redirect health check to use `pbx_run` with `localhost:8085` instead of external curl; batched PBX checks into single `az vm run-command` calls; added retry logic with 15s backoff; fixed macOS `base64` compatibility |
| `services/sip-redirect/app/redirect/handler.py` | Upgraded monitoring log levels (debug→error with traceback for failures, added info log for successful captures) |
| `services/sip-redirect/app/sip/transport.py` | INVITE transaction deduplication (Sprint 53 fix for retransmission race) |
| `services/pbx/config/public-sip.xml` | Extended SIP Timer B timeout to 35s, updated loopback dialplan API key |

### Bug Fix: CI/CD SIP Redirect Deploy Verification

The deploy pipeline verified the SIP redirect version by curling `http://pbx.rcnx.io:8080/version` externally. This failed because: (a) the status server listens on port 8085 (`VVP_STATUS_HTTP_PORT=8085`), not 8080 (occupied by FusionPBX PHP); (b) port 8085 is not exposed through Azure NSG. Fixed by using `az vm run-command` with `localhost:8085`.

### Bug Fix: Azure VM Run-Command Serialization

Azure allows only one `az vm run-command` per VM at a time. The deploy pipeline had separate steps for "deploy code" and "update systemd + restart", causing the second to fail with `Conflict`. Fixed by combining into a single run-command. Same issue in `system-health-check.sh` fixed by batching PBX checks and adding retry logic.

## Sprint 51: Verification Result Caching

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** APPROVED (Pair Review — 11 plan revisions, 2 code review rounds)

### Summary

Cache dossier-derived verification artifacts (chain validation, ACDC signatures, revocation status) keyed by `(dossier_url, passport_kid)`. On cache hit, skip expensive Phases 5, 5.5, and 9 while always re-running per-request phases (PASSporT validation, authorization, SIP context, brand, vetter constraints). VALID-only caching policy prevents sticky failures from transient conditions.

Background revocation checker re-checks credential status asynchronously via TEL, updating all kid variants atomically. Stale revocation data produces INDETERMINATE per §5C.2.

### Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `services/verifier/app/vvp/verification_cache.py` | VerificationResultCache, CachedDossierVerification, RevocationStatus, config fingerprint, metrics |
| `services/verifier/app/vvp/revocation_checker.py` | BackgroundRevocationChecker with URL-deduped async queue |
| `services/verifier/tests/test_verification_cache.py` | 28 unit tests for cache operations |
| `services/verifier/tests/test_background_revocation_checker.py` | 7 unit tests for revocation worker |
| `services/verifier/tests/test_verify_caching.py` | 16 integration tests for cache-first verify_vvp() flow |

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `services/verifier/app/vvp/verify.py` | Cache-first flow after Phase 4; conditional guards on Phases 5, 5.5, 9; cache storage on VALID chain result |
| `services/verifier/app/vvp/api_models.py` | Added `revocation_pending` field to VerifyResponse |
| `services/verifier/app/core/config.py` | 5 config constants: CACHE_ENABLED, MAX_ENTRIES, TTL, RECHECK_INTERVAL, CHECK_CONCURRENCY |
| `services/verifier/app/main.py` | Lifespan context manager for background revocation worker |
| `services/verifier/tests/conftest.py` | Reset verification cache + revocation checker singletons |
| `services/verifier/tests/vectors/conftest.py` | Same reset additions |

### Test Results

1803 tests passed, 0 failures, 9 skipped (51 new tests).

## Sprint 52: Central Service Dashboard

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** APPROVED (Pair Review)

### Summary

Added a central service dashboard to the issuer service at `/ui/dashboard` that aggregates health from all VVP services (verifier, issuer, witnesses, SIP redirect, SIP verify) via a backend proxy endpoint. Features configurable per-service health paths, 2xx acceptance, safe JSON parsing, parallel checks with timeout, and 30-second auto-refresh UI.

### Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `services/issuer/app/api/dashboard.py` | Health aggregation API with parallel httpx checks |
| `services/issuer/web/dashboard.html` | Dashboard UI with auto-refresh and grouped service cards |
| `services/issuer/tests/test_dashboard.py` | 23 tests (unit + integration) |

### Files Modified

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `services/issuer/app/config.py` | Dashboard env vars (VVP_DASHBOARD_SERVICES, SIP URLs, timeout) + auth exemption |
| `services/issuer/app/main.py` | Dashboard router + /ui/dashboard route registration |
| `services/issuer/web/index.html` | Added "Dashboard" nav link |

### Key Features

- **Configurable services**: JSON array env var with per-service name, URL, health_path, category
- **2xx acceptance**: Any 2xx status treated as healthy (not just 200)
- **Safe JSON parsing**: Non-JSON health responses don't crash — version stays null
- **URL normalization**: Handles trailing/leading slash edge cases
- **Auth alignment**: Follows existing UI_AUTH_ENABLED pattern (Microsoft SSO, password, API key)

### Test Results

```
23 passed (test_dashboard.py)
422 passed, 5 skipped (full issuer suite)
```

## Sprint 25: External SAID Resolution from Witnesses

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Commit:** 5cd969f

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/core/config.py` | Modified | Added 5 configuration constants for external SAID resolution feature |
| `app/vvp/keri/credential_cache.py` | Created | Credential-specific LRU cache with TTL expiration |
| `app/vvp/keri/credential_resolver.py` | Created | CredentialResolver class for fetching missing credentials from witnesses |
| `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py` | Modified | Integrated resolver into chain validation, made walk_chain() async |
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Pass resolver and witness URLs when feature enabled |
| `app/vvp/keri/__init__.py` | Modified | Export new credential resolver and cache components |
| `tests/test_credential_cache.py` | Created | Unit tests for credential cache (LRU eviction, TTL, metrics) |
| `tests/test_credential_resolver.py` | Created | Unit tests for resolver with mocked HTTP |
| `tests/test_acdc.py` | Modified | Integration tests for external resolution |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_ExternalSAIDResolution.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Implemented external SAID resolution to fetch missing credentials from KERI witnesses when compact ACDCs have edge references not included in the dossier. Per VVP §2.2, instead of immediately returning INDETERMINATE, the verifier now attempts to resolve external credentials from witnesses.

**Key Features:**

1. **Configuration (opt-in, disabled by default):**
   - `VVP_EXTERNAL_SAID_RESOLUTION` - Enable/disable feature
   - `VVP_EXTERNAL_SAID_TIMEOUT` - HTTP timeout (default: 5.0s)
   - `VVP_EXTERNAL_SAID_MAX_DEPTH` - Max recursion depth (default: 3)
   - `VVP_EXTERNAL_SAID_CACHE_TTL` - Cache TTL (default: 300s)
   - `VVP_EXTERNAL_SAID_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` - Cache max size (default: 500)

2. **CredentialResolver Module:**
   - Fetches credentials from `/credentials/{said}` witness endpoints
   - Parallel witness queries (up to 3) for faster resolution
   - Recursion guard prevents infinite loops
   - Metrics tracking (attempts, successes, failures, cache hits)

3. **CredentialCache Module:**
   - LRU eviction when max_entries exceeded
   - TTL-based expiration
   - Singleton pattern with get/reset functions
   - Cache metrics (hits, misses, evictions, expirations)

4. **Verifier Integration:**
   - `walk_chain()` made async to support async resolution
   - Resolution attempted before INDETERMINATE fallback
   - Resolved credentials added to `dossier_acdcs` for continued validation
   - **Signature verification** for resolved credentials with signatures
   - Resolved credentials without signatures → INDETERMINATE

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Network/timeout errors → INDETERMINATE
   - SAID mismatch → INDETERMINATE
   - Key resolution failed → INDETERMINATE
   - Signature invalid → **INVALID** (cryptographic failure)
   - No signature present → INDETERMINATE
   - Recursion limit → INDETERMINATE

6. **CESR Response Parsing:**
   - Uses `parse_cesr_stream()` for proper CESR attachment handling
   - Extracts controller signatures from `-A` attachments
   - Falls back to plain JSON if CESR parsing fails

**Design Decisions:**

- Feature disabled by default to avoid unexpected network calls
- Separated from TEL client (different concern: credential fetching vs revocation)
- Externally resolved credentials with signatures are cryptographically verified
- Externally resolved credentials without signatures produce INDETERMINATE (not VALID)
- Only signature verification failure produces INVALID; all other failures are recoverable

### Spec References

- §2.2: "Uncertainty must be explicit" - INDETERMINATE when verification cannot determine status
- §1.4: Verifiers MUST support ACDC variants (compact, partial, aggregate)
- §6.3.x: Credential chain validation rules

### Code Review

- **Initial review:** CHANGES_REQUESTED - missing signature verification, CESR parsing issues, cache config not wired
- **Follow-up #1:** CHANGES_REQUESTED - signature verification for credentials WITH signatures still missing
- **Follow-up #2:** APPROVED - all issues addressed

### Test Results

```
1463 passed in 99.32s
```

### Summary

Completed Tier 2 KERI verification capabilities, enabling production-grade KERI witness integration.

**Phase 1: Canonicalization Foundation**
- Flipped `validate_kel_chain()` defaults to safe values (`use_canonical=True`, `validate_saids=True`)
- Added explicit `compute_kel_event_said()` to separate KEL from ACDC SAID computation
- Documented SAID computation differences (KEL uses field ordering, schemas use sorted keys)

**Phase 2: CESR Binary Support**
- Implemented version string parser with deterministic MGPK/CBOR rejection
- Completed -D transferable receipt quadruple parsing
- Completed -V/-\-V attachment group parsing with framing validation
- Added comprehensive negative tests for CESR error conditions

**Phase 3: Production Enablement**
- Removed TEST-ONLY warnings from `kel_resolver.py` and `signature.py`
- Added `TIER2_KEL_RESOLUTION_ENABLED` environment variable support
- Production mode now uses strict validation by default

**Phase 4: Golden Fixtures**
- Created fixture generation script using vendored keripy (v2.0.0-dev5)
- Generated binary CESR fixtures with real Ed25519 signatures
- Fixed CESR signature decoding: strip 2 lead bytes from indexed signatures (88-char qb64 → 66 bytes → 64-byte sig)
- Fixed KERI key decoding: handle CESR qb64 lead bytes (0x04 for B-prefix, 0x0c for D-prefix)
- Added witness receipts fixture with properly signed receipts
- Fixed test helpers to use proper CESR B-prefix encoding (`0x04 || public_key`)

**Key Technical Details:**

1. **CESR Indexed Signatures**: 88-char qb64 decodes to 66 bytes; first 2 are code/index, remaining 64 are Ed25519 signature
2. **CESR Key Lead Bytes**: B-prefix (Ed25519N) uses 0x04, D-prefix (Ed25519) uses 0x0c
3. **Rotation Signing**: Rotation events signed by PRIOR key, not new key

### Test Results

## AID to Identity Resolution Enhancement

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Commit:** d0b7cb1

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/identity.py` | Created | Core identity extraction module with configurable well-known AIDs registry, `IssuerIdentity` dataclass, `build_issuer_identity_map()` function |
| `app/vvp/api_models.py` | Modified | Added `IssuerIdentityInfo` model and `issuer_identities` field to `VerifyResponse` |
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Integrated identity extraction after Phase 5.5, includes delegation chain AIDs via well-known lookup |
| `app/vvp/ui/credential_viewmodel.py` | Modified | Expanded `VCardInfo` with FN, ADR, TEL, EMAIL, URL fields; imports from `identity.py` to avoid duplication |
| `tests/test_identity.py` | Created | 22 unit tests for identity extraction, well-known resolution, lids field handling, vCard ORG fallback |
| `tests/test_credential_viewmodel.py` | Modified | Added 9 new tests for expanded vCard field parsing |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_AID_Identity_Resolution.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Exposed semantic identity (legal name, LEI) of credential issuers in the API response. Per KERI design, an AID alone represents cryptographic control, not semantic identity. This enhancement extracts identity from LE credentials in the dossier and includes it in `VerifyResponse.issuer_identities`.

**Key Features:**

1. **API Response Extension:**
   - `IssuerIdentityInfo` model with `aid`, `legal_name`, `lei`, `source_said`, `identity_source`
   - `VerifyResponse.issuer_identities` optional field (None when no dossier present)
   - `identity_source`: "dossier" (from credentials including vCard) vs "wellknown" (static registry)

2. **Identity Extraction Module (`app/vvp/identity.py`):**
   - Decoupled from UI layer for use in core verification flow
   - `build_issuer_identity_map()` extracts identity from LE credentials
   - Checks `legalName`, `LEI`, `lids` field (string, dict, list variants), and vCard ORG
   - `get_wellknown_identity()` provides fallback for root issuers

3. **Configurable Well-Known AIDs:**
   - `_DEFAULT_WELLKNOWN_AIDS` built-in registry (GLEIF, Provenant, etc.)
   - Overridable via `WELLKNOWN_AIDS_FILE` environment variable (JSON format)
   - Falls back to defaults on file not found or invalid JSON

4. **Delegation Chain Integration:**
   - Delegation chain AIDs included when dossier-sourced identity exists
   - Well-known lookup for delegation chain members not in dossier

5. **Expanded vCard Parsing:**
   - New fields: `fn` (full name), `adr` (address), `tel` (telephone), `email`, `url`
   - Case-insensitive field name parsing

**Design Decisions (per Reviewer):**

1. **Include delegation chain AIDs?** → Yes, optionally when dossier-sourced identity exists
2. **Add organization_type field?** → Deferred until normative source identified
3. **Well-known AIDs configurable?** → Yes, via `WELLKNOWN_AIDS_FILE` env var with built-in defaults

### Checklist Items Completed

- Identity extraction decoupled from UI layer
- API response extended with `issuer_identities` field (backwards compatible)
- vCard field extraction expanded per RFC 6350
- Well-known AIDs configurable via environment variable

### Test Results

```
1245 passed in 70.12s
```

### Review History

- Plan Rev 0: CHANGES_REQUESTED - Wrong function reference (`verify_vvp_identity()` → `verify_vvp()`)
- Plan Rev 1: APPROVED
- Code Rev: APPROVED

## ToIP Dossier Specification Warnings

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Commit:** 3907254

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/dossier/models.py` | Modified | Added `ToIPWarningCode` enum (6 codes) and `DossierWarning` dataclass; added `warnings` field to `DossierDAG` |
| `app/vvp/dossier/validator.py` | Modified | Added `_collect_toip_warnings()` and 6 helper functions for warning detection |
| `app/vvp/dossier/__init__.py` | Modified | Exported `DossierWarning` and `ToIPWarningCode` |
| `app/vvp/api_models.py` | Modified | Added `ToIPWarningDetail` model and `toip_warnings` field to `VerifyResponse` |
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Propagate DAG warnings to API response with logging |
| `app/Documentation/VVP_Verifier_Specification_v1.5.md` | Modified | Added §6.1C Edge Structure, §6.1D Dossier Versioning, updated §5A Step 8 |
| `tests/test_dossier.py` | Modified | Added `TestToIPWarnings` class with 15 test cases |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_ToIP_Warnings.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Implemented non-blocking warnings for ToIP Verifiable Dossiers Specification v0.6 compliance. Where ToIP requirements are stricter than VVP, warnings are emitted but verification is not failed. This provides transparency for dossier producers without breaking compatibility.

**Warning Codes:**

| Code | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| `EDGE_MISSING_SCHEMA` | Edge has `n` but no `s` (schema SAID) |
| `EDGE_NON_OBJECT_FORMAT` | Edge is direct SAID string, not `{n,s}` object |
| `DOSSIER_HAS_ISSUEE` | Root dossier ACDC has issuee (`a.i`) or registry (`ri`) field |
| `DOSSIER_HAS_PREV_EDGE` | Dossier has `prev` edge indicating versioning |
| `EVIDENCE_IN_ATTRIBUTES` | Evidence-like data in attributes (`a`) instead of edges (`e`) |
| `JOINT_ISSUANCE_OPERATOR` | Joint issuance operators (`thr`/`fin`/`rev`) detected |

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Non-blocking warnings**: Warnings do not affect validation result per §6.1C-D
2. **DAG-level collection**: Warnings collected during `validate_dag()` and stored on `DossierDAG.warnings`
3. **API propagation**: Warnings serialized to `VerifyResponse.toip_warnings` as optional array
4. **Immutable warnings**: `DossierWarning` is a frozen dataclass for thread safety

**Spec Updates:**

- §6.1C Edge Structure: Documents ToIP edge format requirements and warning behavior
- §6.1D Dossier Versioning: Documents `prev` edge handling and SHOULD requirements
- §5A Step 8: Added two-layer verification model (cryptographic vs semantic)

### Checklist Items Completed

- ToIP warning infrastructure added to dossier validation layer
- API response extended with `toip_warnings` field (backwards compatible)
- VVP Specification v1.5 updated with new sections

### Test Results

```
1214 passed, 19 warnings in 66.90s
```

### Review History

- Rev 0: CHANGES_REQUESTED - Missing `prev` edge warning, no warning for direct SAID strings
- Rev 1: APPROVED - Added `DOSSIER_HAS_PREV_EDGE` and `EDGE_NON_OBJECT_FORMAT` codes

## Sprint 25: Delegation Chain UI Visibility

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Commit:** d4df2ae

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/api_models.py` | Modified | Added `DelegationNodeResponse`, `DelegationChainResponse` models; extended `VerifyResponse` with `delegation_chain` and `signer_aid` fields |
| `app/vvp/keri/signature.py` | Modified | Refactored Tier 2 verification with shared `_verify_passport_signature_tier2_impl()`, added `verify_passport_signature_tier2_with_key_state()` |
| `app/vvp/keri/__init__.py` | Modified | Exported `verify_passport_signature_tier2_with_key_state` |
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Added `_build_delegation_response()` helper, captures delegation chain and signer AID in verification flow |
| `app/vvp/ui/credential_viewmodel.py` | Modified | Added `build_delegation_chain_info()` function for API→UI view model conversion |
| `app/main.py` | Modified | Added `/ui/verify-result` endpoint with proper VVP-Identity header construction |
| `app/templates/partials/verify_result.html` | Created | Verification result template with delegation chain visualization |
| `tests/test_delegation_ui.py` | Created | 20 unit tests for delegation UI models and functions |
| `tests/test_verify.py` | Modified | Updated mocks for new `verify_passport_signature_tier2_with_key_state` function |
| `tests/test_dossier_cache.py` | Modified | Updated mocks for new function signature |
| `tests/vectors/runner.py` | Modified | Updated mocks for new function signature |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Sprint25.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Surfaces delegation chain information in the UI when verification results are available. The backend already computes delegation chain data during Tier 2 signature verification, but this data was previously lost.

**Key Features:**

1. **API Response Extension:**
   - `DelegationNodeResponse` model for individual chain nodes
   - `DelegationChainResponse` model for complete chain with validation status
   - `VerifyResponse.delegation_chain` optional field (backwards compatible)
   - `VerifyResponse.signer_aid` for credential-to-delegation mapping

2. **Tier 2 Verification Refactor:**
   - Shared `_verify_passport_signature_tier2_impl()` to avoid duplication
   - New `verify_passport_signature_tier2_with_key_state()` returns (KeyState, auth_status)
   - Proper INVALID vs INDETERMINATE status mapping based on authorization result

3. **Delegation Status Mapping (per reviewer feedback):**
   - `chain.valid=True, auth_status="VALID"` → VALID
   - `chain.valid=True, auth_status="INVALID"` → INVALID (definitive failure)
   - `chain.valid=True, auth_status="INDETERMINATE"` → INDETERMINATE (incomplete)
   - `chain.valid=False` → INVALID (chain structure invalid)

4. **UI Verify Result Endpoint (`/ui/verify-result`):**
   - Parses PASSporT JWT to extract `kid` and `iat` for VVP-Identity header (§5.2)
   - Performs full verification via `verify_vvp()`
   - Builds delegation_info and attaches to credentials where issuer == signer_aid
   - Returns delegation banner and chain visualization

5. **Credential-to-Delegation Mapping:**
   - Delegation applies to the PASSporT signer (kid AID)
   - Attached to credentials where issuer AID matches signer AID
   - Dossier-level banner shown when no credential matches

### Checklist Items Completed

- UI: Delegation chain visualization on verification results
- API: Delegation chain data in VerifyResponse
- Backend: Capture delegation data during Tier 2 verification

### Test Results

```
1198 passed, 20 warnings in 69.86s
```

### Review History

- Plan Rev 0: CHANGES_REQUESTED - Status mapping and credential mapping issues
- Plan Rev 1: APPROVED
- Code Rev 0: CHANGES_REQUESTED - VVP-Identity header used evd_url instead of kid
- Code Rev 1 (Sprint 25.1): APPROVED - Fixed to parse PASSporT JWT for kid/iat

### Summary

Implemented view-model pattern for credential card UI per Sprint 21 plan, decoupling templates from raw ACDC field variations.

**Key Changes:**

1. **View-Model Adapter:**
   - `CredentialCardViewModel` normalizes ACDC data for templates
   - Primary/secondary attribute extraction per credential type (APE, DE, TNAlloc, LE)
   - Edge normalization handles string, dict with n/d, and list formats
   - Variant limitation detection for compact/partial credentials

2. **Status vs Revocation Separation:**
   - `status`: ClaimStatus (VALID/INVALID/INDETERMINATE) from chain validation
   - `revocation`: RevocationStatus (ACTIVE/REVOKED/UNKNOWN) from TEL

3. **Redaction Detection:**
   - Detects `"_"` full redaction placeholder
   - Detects `"_:type"` typed placeholders (e.g., `"_:string"`)
   - Surfaces limitations in UI banners

4. **HTMX Endpoints:**
   - `/ui/revocation-badge`: Lazy revocation badge with OOBI query support
   - `/ui/credential/{said}`: Placeholder for chain expansion (pending session storage)

5. **Template Backwards Compatibility:**
   - Template accepts both `vm` (new) and `acdc` (legacy) for gradual migration

Implemented VVP §1.4 MUST requirement for ACDC variants: compact, partial, and aggregate.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Variant Detection & Storage (§1.4):**
   - `detect_acdc_variant()` identifies full/compact/partial variants
   - Variants stored in `ACDC.variant` field for downstream handling
   - No longer rejected at parse time

2. **Compact Variant Handling:**
   - External edge refs (SAID not in dossier) → `INDETERMINATE` (not raise)
   - Edge-based credential type detection for compact ACDCs
   - Log message: "Cannot verify edge target {SAID} (compact variant)"

3. **Partial Variant Handling:**
   - Placeholder issuee (`"_"` or `"_:*"`) → `INDETERMINATE`
   - Cannot verify binding with redacted fields

4. **Aggregate Dossier Support (§6.1):**
   - `VVP_ALLOW_AGGREGATE_DOSSIERS` env var (default: false)
   - Multi-root DAGs accepted when enabled
   - `dag.is_aggregate` flag for downstream logic

5. **Chain Status Aggregation:**
   - Non-aggregate: at least one valid chain suffices (prior behavior)
   - Aggregate: ALL chains must validate (stricter requirement)
   - Prevents false positives when multiple independent trust hierarchies

### Checklist Items Completed

- 8.9: Handle ACDC variants (compact, partial, aggregate)
- 15.9: Valid ACDC variant test vector

### Test Results

```
899 passed in 5.09s

### Summary

Completed Phase 12 (Callee Verification per VVP §5B) and Sprint 18 code review fixes.

**Part A: Sprint 18 Code Review Fixes:**

1. **A1: CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED not applied** (High)
   - Added `context_required` parameter to `verify_sip_context_alignment()`
   - When `True`, missing SIP context returns INVALID (not INDETERMINATE)

2. **A2: SIP_TIMING_TOLERANCE_SECONDS not used** (Medium)
   - Plumbed `SIP_TIMING_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` config through to verification
   - Custom timing tolerance now respected (default 30s)

3. **A3: DE selection uses first DE instead of signer's DE** (Medium)
   - Created `_find_signer_de_credential()` to find DE by signer AID
   - Prevents false positives/negatives with multiple DEs in dossier

**Part B: Phase 12 Callee Verification (15 items):**

1. **Dialog Matching (§5B Step 1)**
   - `validate_dialog_match()` validates call-id and cseq against SIP INVITE
   - Missing or mismatched values return INVALID (DIALOG_MISMATCH)

2. **Issuer Verification (§5B Step 9)**
   - `validate_issuer_match()` ensures dossier issuer AID matches PASSporT kid
   - Mismatched issuer returns INVALID (ISSUER_MISMATCH)

3. **Goal Overlap Verification (§5B Step 14)**
   - `is_goal_subset()` - hierarchical goal comparison (e.g., "billing.payment" ⊂ "billing")
   - `validate_goal_overlap()` - one goal must be subset of the other
   - `verify_goal_overlap()` - returns ClaimBuilder, REQUIRED when both goals present

4. **Callee TN Rights (§5B Step 12)**
   - `validate_callee_tn_rights()` validates callee can RECEIVE at the number
   - Uses existing `_find_credentials_by_type()` infrastructure

5. **New Error Codes**
   - `DIALOG_MISMATCH` - call-id/cseq don't match SIP INVITE (non-recoverable)
   - `ISSUER_MISMATCH` - dossier issuer != passport kid (non-recoverable)

6. **Claim Tree (per §3.3B)**
   ```
   callee_verified (root)
   ├── passport_verified (REQUIRED)
   │   ├── dialog_matched (REQUIRED)
   │   ├── timing_valid (REQUIRED)

## Sprint 17: APE Vetting Edge & Schema Validation

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `54f507b`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py` | Modified | Fixed is_root bypass for APE vetting edges; added `validate_ape_vetting_target()` |
| `app/vvp/keri/key_parser.py` | Modified | Added documentation for §4.2 single-sig AID enforcement |
| `tests/test_acdc.py` | Modified | Added 4 new tests for APE vetting validation, added `KNOWN_LE_SCHEMA` constant |
| `app/Documentation/VVP_Implementation_Checklist.md` | Modified | Phase 10 100% complete, overall 79% |

### Summary

Completed remaining MUST requirements in Phase 10 (Authorization Verification) per VVP spec §6.3.3, §4.2, and §6.3.5.

**Key Changes:**

1. **APE Vetting Edge Always Required (§6.3.3):**
   - Fixed `validate_edge_semantics()` to not skip required edge checks for APE credentials
   - Previous code allowed `is_root=True` to bypass vetting edge requirement
   - APE credentials MUST have vetting edge → LE credential, even when issued by trusted root

2. **APE Vetting Target Validation (§6.3.3, §6.3.5):**
   - Added `validate_ape_vetting_target()` function
   - Validates vetting target credential type is LE (not TNAlloc, DE, etc.)
   - Validates vetting LE credential uses known vLEI schema SAID
   - Respects `SCHEMA_VALIDATION_STRICT` config flag

3. **Single-Sig AID Documentation (§4.2):**
   - Added comprehensive documentation to `key_parser.py`
   - Only B/D prefixes accepted (Ed25519 single-sig codes)
   - Multi-sig AIDs (E, F, M prefixes) rejected
   - Item 10.18 already enforced, now documented

4. **Test Updates:**
   - Added `KNOWN_LE_SCHEMA` constant for test fixtures
   - Updated 4 existing tests to use known LE schema SAID
   - Added 4 new Sprint 17 tests for APE vetting validation

### Checklist Items Completed

- 10.12: APE must include vetting edge → LE credential
- 10.18: kid AID single-sig validation (already enforced, documented)
- 10.19: Vetting credential must conform to LE vLEI schema

### Test Results

```
752 passed, 2 skipped in 4.89s

## Sprint 16: Delegation Authorization (Case B)

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `6e5387d`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/authorization.py` | Modified | Added `_find_delegation_target()`, `_verify_delegation_chain()` for Case B delegation |
| `tests/test_authorization.py` | Modified | Added 9 new tests for Case B delegation scenarios (45 total) |

### Summary

Implemented VVP Specification §5A Step 10 Case B: Delegation chain validation.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Delegation Chain Validation (Case B):**
   - `_find_delegation_target()`: Finds credential referenced by DE's delegation edge
   - `_verify_delegation_chain()`: Walks DE → APE chain to identify accountable party
   - DE issuee must match PASSporT signer (OP is delegate)
   - Chain terminates when APE credential reached
   - APE issuee is the accountable party (used for TN rights binding)

2. **Multi-Level Delegation:**
   - Supports nested delegation: DE → DE → ... → APE
   - Maximum chain depth of 10 (configurable)
   - Cycle detection prevents infinite loops

3. **Error Handling:**
   - No DE for signer → INVALID
   - Missing delegation target → INVALID
   - Circular delegation → INVALID
   - Chain too deep → INVALID

4. **TN Rights Binding:**
   - TNAlloc must be bound to accountable party (APE issuee), not delegate
   - Ensures proper authorization chain even with delegation

### Checklist Items Completed

- 10.5: Case B - verify delegation credential chain
- 10.14: If delegation, verify DE includes delegated signer credential
- 10.17: Verify OP is issuee of delegated signer credential

### Revision 1 (Review Fixes)

**Issues Addressed:**
- [High]: Case B selection now only uses delegation when DE issuee matches signer
- [Medium]: All matching DEs are tried; first valid chain wins

**Changes:**
- Refactored `_verify_delegation_chain()` into `_walk_de_chain()` + `_verify_delegation_chain()`
- `verify_party_authorization()` now filters DEs by issuee == signer before deciding Case B
- Unrelated DEs (issuee != signer) no longer force Case B; falls back to Case A

### Test Results

```
748 passed, 2 skipped in 4.77s

## Sprint 15: Authorization Verification (§5A Steps 10-11)

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `82c88a0`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/authorization.py` | Created | Authorization module with party authorization and TN rights validation (~265 lines) |
| `app/vvp/api_models.py` | Modified | Added `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED`, `TN_RIGHTS_INVALID` error codes |
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Wired `authorization_valid` claim into claim tree (~98 lines added) |
| `tests/test_authorization.py` | Created | 36 unit tests for authorization verification |
| `tests/vectors/data/v*.json` | Modified | Updated expected claim tree structure for authorization claims |
| `REVIEW.md` | Modified | Added Sprint 15 review records |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Sprint15.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Implemented VVP Specification §5A Steps 10-11: Party authorization and TN rights validation for Case A (no delegation).

**Key Changes:**

1. **Party Authorization (Step 10):**
   - `verify_party_authorization()` finds APE credential where issuee == PASSporT signer AID
   - Case A (no delegation): Direct match proves OP is accountable party
   - Case B (DE delegation): Returns INDETERMINATE (deferred to future sprint)
   - Error code: `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED`

2. **TN Rights Validation (Step 11):**
   - `verify_tn_rights()` validates orig.tn is covered by TNAlloc credential
   - **Binding requirement**: TNAlloc must be issued to the accountable party (issuee match)
   - When party authorization fails: TN rights returns INDETERMINATE (no party to bind to)
   - Uses existing `tn_utils.py` for E.164 parsing and subset validation
   - Error code: `TN_RIGHTS_INVALID`

3. **Claim Tree Structure:**
   ```
   caller_authorised
   ├── passport_verified (REQUIRED)
   ├── dossier_verified (REQUIRED)
   └── authorization_valid (REQUIRED)      ← NEW
       ├── party_authorized (REQUIRED)     ← NEW
       └── tn_rights_valid (REQUIRED)      ← NEW
   ```

4. **AuthorizationContext Dataclass:**
   - `pss_signer_aid`: AID extracted from PASSporT kid header
   - `orig_tn`: E.164 phone number from passport.payload.orig["tn"]
   - `dossier_acdcs`: All ACDC credentials parsed from the dossier

### Review History

- **Rev 0**: CHANGES_REQUESTED - TN rights not bound to accountable party
- **Rev 1**: APPROVED - Added `authorized_aid` parameter, TNAlloc issuee binding

### Checklist Items Completed

- 10.2: Extract originating party AID from PASSporT
- 10.4: Case A - verify orig = accountable (via APE issuee)
- 10.6: Locate TNAlloc in dossier
- 10.7: Compare orig field to TNAlloc credential (bound to accountable party)
- 10.9: Add caller_authorized claim to tree
- 10.10: Add tn_rights_valid claim to tree
- 10.11: Unit tests for authorization

### Test Results

```
737 passed, 2 skipped in 4.79s

## Sprint 14: Tier 2 Completion - Schema, Edge Semantics, TNAlloc

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `0b7fe93`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/acdc/schema_registry.py` | Created | Versioned schema SAID registry with vLEI governance sources |
| `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py` | Modified | Added `validate_edge_semantics()`, integrated into chain validation, strict schema validation |
| `app/vvp/acdc/parser.py` | Modified | Added `detect_acdc_variant()` for explicit variant rejection |
| `app/vvp/tn_utils.py` | Created | E.164 parsing, wildcard support, range subset validation |
| `tests/test_acdc.py` | Modified | Added 19 tests for edge semantics and variant detection |
| `tests/test_tn_utils.py` | Created | 15 tests for TN utilities |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase14.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Completed remaining Tier 2 ACDC validation requirements per spec §6.3.x and §1.4.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Schema SAID Validation (§6.3.x):**
   - `validate_schema_said()` now defaults to `strict=True`
   - Known LE schema SAIDs from vLEI governance framework
   - APE/DE/TNAlloc schemas accept any (pending governance publication)
   - Versioned registry in `schema_registry.py` with source documentation

2. **Edge Relationship Semantics (§6.3.3/§6.3.4/§6.3.6):**
   - `validate_edge_semantics()` validates credential type-specific edge rules
   - APE: MUST have vetting edge → LE credential
   - DE: MUST have delegation edge → APE or DE credential
   - TNAlloc: Should have JL edge → parent TNAlloc (unless root)
   - Integrated into `walk_chain()` for automatic enforcement
   - Missing required edge targets raise `ACDCChainInvalid`

3. **ACDC Variant Detection (§1.4 explicit handling):**
   - `detect_acdc_variant()` detects full, compact, and partial variants
   - Full variants: expanded `a` field present → accepted
   - Compact variants: missing/string `a` field → `ParseError`
   - Partial variants: `"_"` placeholders → `ParseError`
   - Documented non-compliance until full variant support implemented

4. **TNAlloc Phone Number Validation (§6.3.6):**
   - E.164 format validation with `+` prefix requirement
   - Wildcard support (`+1555*` → range expansion)
   - Hyphenated range parsing (`+15550000000-+15559999999`)
   - `is_subset()` validates child ranges covered by parent
   - Mixed list/range/dict inputs supported

### Checklist Items Completed

- 8.6: ACDC schema SAID validation (strict by default)
- 8.8: Edge/relationship semantic validation
- 8.9: ACDC variants (explicit rejection with documented non-compliance)
- 8.11: TNAlloc JL validation with phone number range subset

### Test Results

```
701 passed, 2 skipped, 20 warnings in 4.81s

## Phase 13B: Separation of Concerns Refactoring

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `dd95391`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/main.py` | Modified | Refactored `/ui/parse-jwt` to use domain layer `parse_passport()`, added permissive decode mode with spec reference mapping, removed dead code (`_base64url_decode`, `_parse_jwt_logic`, `_extract_acdcs_from_dossier`) |
| `app/vvp/dossier/parser.py` | Modified | Added Provenant wrapper format support (`{"details": "..."}`) and permissive CESR extraction fallback |
| `app/templates/partials/jwt_result.html` | Modified | Added validation warning display with spec section references in table format |
| `tests/test_ui_endpoints.py` | Created | 14 integration tests for UI endpoint behavior and domain layer alignment |
| `tests/test_dossier.py` | Modified | Added 2 tests for Provenant wrapper format parsing |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Modified | Added pre-authorization for pytest with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH |

### Summary

Phase 13B refactors the HTMX UI layer to properly delegate to the domain layer, fixing separation of concerns violations introduced in Phase 13.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Domain Layer Delegation (§5.0-5.2):**
   - `/ui/parse-jwt` now uses `parse_passport()` from `app/vvp/passport.py`
   - Removed duplicate base64url decoding and JWT parsing logic
   - Domain layer validation errors properly propagated to UI

2. **Permissive Decode Mode:**
   - JWT content shown even when validation fails
   - Validation errors displayed separately with "Validation Warning" banner
   - Spec section references mapped to error messages (20+ patterns)
   - Users can see decoded content and understand why validation failed

3. **Spec Reference Mapping:**
   - `SPEC_SECTION_MAP` dictionary maps error patterns to spec sections
   - Examples: `forbidden algorithm` → `§5.0, §5.1`, `orig.tn must be a single phone number` → `§4.2`
   - Template displays spec section and description alongside error message

4. **Provenant Dossier Format Support:**
   - Added handling for `{"details": "...CESR content..."}` wrapper format
   - Permissive CESR extraction when strict parsing fails (unknown attachment codes)
   - Filters KEL events from ACDCs using schema SAID format check
   - Deduplicates credentials by SAID

5. **Dead Code Removal:**
   - Deleted `_base64url_decode()` - replaced by domain layer
   - Deleted `_parse_jwt_logic()` - replaced by `parse_passport()`
   - Deleted `_extract_acdcs_from_dossier()` - no longer used

### Test Coverage

- 14 new UI endpoint integration tests
- 2 new Provenant wrapper format tests
- 621 total tests passing

| `app/Documentation/VVP_Implementation_Checklist.md` | Modified | Updated to 68% complete |

### Summary

Completed remaining Tier 2 validation requirements per VVP spec §4.2, §6.3.5, and §7.3.

**Key Changes:**

1. **E.164 Phone Number Validation (§4.2):**
   - `orig.tn` must be single string (not array) in E.164 format
   - `dest.tn` must be array of E.164 phone numbers
   - Pattern: `+[1-9][0-9]{1,14}` per ITU-T E.164

2. **typ Header Validation (RFC8225):**
   - If `typ` header present, must be "passport"
   - Missing typ is allowed (optional field)

3. **Issuee Binding Validation (§6.3.5):**
   - Credentials must not be bearer tokens
   - Non-root credentials must have issuee field (`i`, `issuee`, or `holder`)
   - Root credentials (from trusted AIDs) may omit issuee

4. **Witness Signature Validation (§7.3):**
   - `validate_witnesses=strict_validation` in KEL resolution
   - Strict mode validates witness receipt signatures
   - Non-strict mode allows for testing without full witness setup

### Checklist Items Completed

- 3.14: `orig.tn` single phone number validation
- 3.15: `typ` header validation
- 3.16: E.164 format validation
- 7.16: Witness receipt signature validation

## Phase 11: Tier 2 Integration & Compliance

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `b766b00`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Added Phase 5.5 chain_verified claim, Tier 2 PASSporT routing, ACDC chain validation integration, leaf credential selection |
| `app/vvp/keri/kel_resolver.py` | Modified | Added `strict_validation` parameter to `_fetch_and_validate_oobi()` for production vs test mode |

| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase11.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Integrated Tier 2 verification components into the main verification flow per spec §4.2, §5A Step 8, and §6.3.x.

**Key Changes:**

1. **ACDC Chain Validation Integration (§6.3.x):**
   - `chain_verified` claim added as REQUIRED child of `dossier_verified`
   - Chain validation starts from leaf credentials (APE/DE/TNAlloc), not just DAG root
   - `_find_leaf_credentials()` helper identifies credentials not referenced by edges
   - At least one leaf must validate to a trusted root

2. **Strict OOBI KEL Validation (§4.2):**
   - `_fetch_and_validate_oobi()` now accepts `strict_validation` parameter
   - Production mode: canonical KERI validation with SAID checks
   - Test mode: allows placeholder SAIDs and non-canonical serialization
   - ACDC signature verification uses strict key resolution

3. **PASSporT-Optional Chain Verification (§5A Step 8):**
   - Chain verification runs when dossier is present, even if PASSporT is absent
   - PSS signer binding for DE credentials only enforced when PASSporT available

4. **CESR Signature Extraction:**
   - Dossier parser detects CESR format and extracts controller signatures
   - Returns `Tuple[List[ACDCNode], Dict[str, bytes]]` with SAID→signature mapping
   - Signatures verified against issuer key state in production mode

5. **Schema Validation Configuration:**
   - `SCHEMA_VALIDATION_STRICT` flag (default True per spec)
   - False is a documented policy deviation for testing

**Spec Compliance:**
- §4.2: OOBI MUST resolve to valid KEL (enforced via strict validation)
- §5A Step 8: Dossier cryptographic verification MUST be performed
- §6.3.3-6: ACDC schema/credential type rules enforced from leaves

   - `TRUSTED_ROOT_AIDS` frozenset from `VVP_TRUSTED_ROOT_AIDS` env var
   - Default: GLEIF External AID for production vLEI ecosystem
   - Supports multiple comma-separated roots

2. **PSS CESR Signature Decoding (§6.3.1):**
   - `decode_pss_signature()` handles 0A/0B/0C/0D/AA prefixed CESR signatures
   - Auto-detection in `_decode_signature()` with fallback to base64url

3. **OOBI KEL Validation (§4.2):**

## Phase 9.4: TEL Resolution Architecture Fix

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `4de5855`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Added `_query_registry_tel()` helper, inline TEL parsing with latin-1 decoding, registry OOBI discovery |
| `app/vvp/keri/tel_client.py` | Modified | Added detailed logging to `parse_dossier_tel()` |
| `tests/test_revocation_checker.py` | Modified | Added 7 new tests for inline TEL, registry OOBI, binary-safe parsing |
| `app/main.py` | Modified | Added `POST /admin/log-level` endpoint for runtime log level changes |
| `tests/test_admin.py` | Modified | Added 6 tests for log level endpoint |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase9.4.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Fixed TEL resolution architecture so revocation checking works correctly instead of always returning INDETERMINATE.

**Problem:** The previous implementation queried the wrong endpoints (PASSporT signer's KERIA agent instead of registry witnesses), causing all TEL queries to return 404.

**Solution:**
1. **Inline TEL Parsing**: Check if TEL events are embedded in the raw dossier using binary-safe latin-1 decoding
2. **Registry OOBI Discovery**: Derive registry OOBI URL from base OOBI pattern (`{scheme}://{netloc}/oobi/{registry_said}`)
3. **Fallback Chain**: Inline TEL → Registry OOBI witnesses → Default witnesses

**Key Changes:**
- `check_dossier_revocations()` now accepts `raw_dossier` parameter for inline TEL parsing
- Latin-1 decoding preserves all byte values (byte-transparent) for CESR streams
- Evidence format standardized: `revocation_source:{dossier|witness}` with summary counts
- Runtime log level endpoint: `POST /admin/log-level` with `{"level": "DEBUG"}` body
- 440 tests passing (20 revocation tests)

**Spec Compliance:**
- §5.1.1-2.9: Revocation status checking via correct TEL sources
- §6.1B: Inline TEL events in CESR dossier format supported

---

| `tests/vectors/runner.py` | Modified | Added TEL client mock for deterministic tests |
| `app/Documentation/VVP_Implementation_Checklist.md` | Modified | Updated to v3.3, Phase 9 100% complete |

### Summary

Integrated revocation checking into the main verification flow per spec §5.1.1-2.9.

**Key Changes:**
- `revocation_clear` claim is now a REQUIRED child of `dossier_verified` per §3.3B
- `dossier_verified` status propagates from `revocation_clear` per §3.3A
- `CREDENTIAL_REVOKED` errors emitted for each revoked credential
- `/admin` endpoint exposes all configuration values (gated by `ADMIN_ENDPOINT_ENABLED`)
- INFO-level logging added to TEL client for debugging
- 480 tests passing (11 new revocation tests, 9 new admin tests)

**Spec Compliance:**
- §5.1.1-2.9: Revocation status checking for all ACDCs in dossier
- §3.3B: `revocation_clear` placed under `dossier_verified`
- §3.3A: Status propagation (INVALID > INDETERMINATE > VALID)

| `tests/test_canonicalization.py` | Created | Canonical ordering tests |
| `tests/fixtures/keri/*.json` | Created | Test fixtures from keripy |

### Summary

Integrated with Provenant staging witnesses for live KERI ecosystem testing.

**Key Changes:**
- CESR stream parsing for witness OOBI responses
- KERI-compliant field ordering for serialization
- TEL client infrastructure for revocation checking
- Provenant witness endpoints: witness4/5/6.stage.provenant.net:5631
- Verified live resolution with test AID `EGay5ufBqAanbhFa_qe-KMFUPJHn8J0MFba96yyWRrLF`

**Documentation:**
- Created ROADMAP.md with tier architecture overview
- Updated checklist to reflect implementation progress (60%)
- Archived old spec versions (v1.1, v1.2, v1.3)

### Normative Note: `kid` Field Semantics

Per VVP draft and KERI specifications:

> **`kid` is an OOBI reference to a KERI autonomous identifier whose historical key state, witness receipts, and delegations MUST be resolved and validated to determine which signing key was authorised at the PASSporT reference time.**

This means `kid` is NOT a generic JWT key ID - resolution requires OOBI dereferencing and KEL validation at reference time T.

| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase7.md` | Created | Archived phase plan |

### Summary

Implemented Tier 2 KERI key state resolution for historical key verification per VVP §5A Step 4 and §5D.

**Components:**
- OOBI dereferencer for fetching KEL data from witness endpoints
- KEL event parser with chain continuity and signature validation
- Key state resolver that determines signing keys valid at reference time T
- LRU cache keyed by (AID, establishment_digest) with time-based secondary index

**Feature Gating:**
- `TIER2_KEL_RESOLUTION_ENABLED = False` by default
- Tier 2 is TEST-ONLY due to limitations:
  - JSON-only (CESR binary format not supported)
  - Signature canonicalization uses JSON sorted-keys (not KERI-compliant Blake3)
  - SAID validation disabled by default
- Tests use `_allow_test_mode=True` to bypass feature gate

### Spec Sections Implemented

- §5A Step 4: Resolve issuer key state at reference time T
- §5C.2: Key state cache (AID + timestamp → rotation-sensitive)
- §5D: Historical verification capabilities

### Test Results

```
97 passed (Phase 7 tests)
368 passed, 2 skipped (full test suite)
```

## Phase 9: VVP Verifier Specification v1.5

**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Commit:** `953e694`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/Documentation/VVP_Verifier_Specification_v1.5.md` | Created | Complete verification algorithm specification |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase9.md` | Created | Archived plan for Phase 9 |

### Summary

Extended VVP_Verifier_Specification_v1.4_FINAL with complete verification algorithms per authoritative VVP draft §5.

**New Sections:**
- §3.3B: Complete claim tree structure for caller and callee verification
- §4.2A: 8 new error codes (CREDENTIAL_REVOKED, CONTEXT_MISMATCH, AUTHORIZATION_FAILED, TN_RIGHTS_INVALID, BRAND_CREDENTIAL_INVALID, GOAL_REJECTED, DIALOG_MISMATCH, ISSUER_MISMATCH)
- §4.4: SIP Context Fields normative section
- §5A: 13-step Caller Verification Algorithm per VVP §5.1
- §5B: 14-step Callee Verification Algorithm per VVP §5.2
- §5C: Efficiency and Caching guidance per VVP §5.3
- §5D: Historical Verification capabilities per VVP §5.4
- §9: Full pseudocode for caller and callee verification with explicit claim node initialization
- §10.2: Test vectors tiered by implementation phase (Tier 1/2/3)
- §12: Implementation Tiers (Tier 1/2/3)
- Appendix A: Spec §5 Traceability Matrix

**Key Design Decisions:**
- SIP context absence produces INDETERMINATE, not rejection (policy-driven)
- Replay tolerance (30s) distinguished from iat binding tolerance (5s)
- `issuer_matched` placed under `dossier_verified` in callee claim tree
- Step-to-claim mapping tables added to prevent drift

### Spec Sections Implemented

| `app/vvp/exceptions.py` | Modified | Added PassportError exception class |
| `app/vvp/passport.py` | Created | PASSporT JWT parser and validator per §5.0-§5.4 |
| `tests/test_passport.py` | Created | 68 unit tests for PASSporT parsing |

### Summary

- Created `PassportError` exception class with factory methods:
  - `missing()` → `PASSPORT_MISSING`
  - `parse_failed(reason)` → `PASSPORT_PARSE_FAILED` (binding violations, structure errors)
  - `forbidden_alg(alg)` → `PASSPORT_FORBIDDEN_ALG`
  - `expired(reason)` → `PASSPORT_EXPIRED` (actual expiry policy failures only)
- Created frozen dataclasses: `PassportHeader`, `PassportPayload`, `Passport`
- Implemented `parse_passport(jwt)` function:
  - JWT structure parsing (header.payload.signature)
  - Algorithm enforcement: accept EdDSA only, reject none/ES256/HMAC/RSA (§5.0, §5.1)
  - Header validation: require `alg`, `ppt`, `kid`; ignore `typ` (§5.2)
  - Payload validation: require `iat`, `orig`, `dest`, `evd` (local policy)
  - Support optional fields: `iss`, `exp`, `card`, `goal`, `call-reason`→`call_reason`, `origid`
  - Validate `ppt` = "vvp" per §5.2
- Implemented `validate_passport_binding(passport, vvp_identity, now)` function:
  - `ppt` binding: PASSporT ppt must match VVP-Identity ppt (§5.2)
  - `kid` binding: strict equality in Phase 3 (§5.2)
  - `iat` drift: ≤5 seconds between PASSporT and VVP-Identity (§5.2A)
  - `exp > iat` validation (§5.2A)
  - `exp` drift: ≤5 seconds when both present (§5.2A)
  - Expiry policy: max validity 300s, clock skew ±300s (§5.2B)
- Preserved raw header/payload and signature bytes for Phase 4 signature verification

### Error Code Usage

| Error Code | Used For |
|------------|----------|
| `PASSPORT_MISSING` | JWT is None or empty |
| `PASSPORT_PARSE_FAILED` | Malformed JWT, invalid base64/JSON, missing fields, binding violations (ppt/kid mismatch, iat drift, exp mismatch) |
| `PASSPORT_FORBIDDEN_ALG` | Algorithm not in allowed list (only EdDSA accepted) |
| `PASSPORT_EXPIRED` | Token expired, validity window exceeded, max-age exceeded |

### Spec Sections Implemented
