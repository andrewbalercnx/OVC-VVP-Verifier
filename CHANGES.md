### Summary

Completed Phase 12 (Callee Verification per VVP §5B) and Sprint 18 code review fixes.

**Part A: Sprint 18 Code Review Fixes:**

1. **A1: CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED not applied** (High)
   - Added `context_required` parameter to `verify_sip_context_alignment()`
   - When `True`, missing SIP context returns INVALID (not INDETERMINATE)

2. **A2: SIP_TIMING_TOLERANCE_SECONDS not used** (Medium)
   - Plumbed `SIP_TIMING_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` config through to verification
   - Custom timing tolerance now respected (default 30s)

3. **A3: DE selection uses first DE instead of signer's DE** (Medium)
   - Created `_find_signer_de_credential()` to find DE by signer AID
   - Prevents false positives/negatives with multiple DEs in dossier

**Part B: Phase 12 Callee Verification (15 items):**

1. **Dialog Matching (§5B Step 1)**
   - `validate_dialog_match()` validates call-id and cseq against SIP INVITE
   - Missing or mismatched values return INVALID (DIALOG_MISMATCH)

2. **Issuer Verification (§5B Step 9)**
   - `validate_issuer_match()` ensures dossier issuer AID matches PASSporT kid
   - Mismatched issuer returns INVALID (ISSUER_MISMATCH)

3. **Goal Overlap Verification (§5B Step 14)**
   - `is_goal_subset()` - hierarchical goal comparison (e.g., "billing.payment" ⊂ "billing")
   - `validate_goal_overlap()` - one goal must be subset of the other
   - `verify_goal_overlap()` - returns ClaimBuilder, REQUIRED when both goals present

4. **Callee TN Rights (§5B Step 12)**
   - `validate_callee_tn_rights()` validates callee can RECEIVE at the number
   - Uses existing `_find_credentials_by_type()` infrastructure

5. **New Error Codes**
   - `DIALOG_MISMATCH` - call-id/cseq don't match SIP INVITE (non-recoverable)
   - `ISSUER_MISMATCH` - dossier issuer != passport kid (non-recoverable)

6. **Claim Tree (per §3.3B)**
   ```
   callee_verified (root)
   ├── passport_verified (REQUIRED)
   │   ├── dialog_matched (REQUIRED)
   │   ├── timing_valid (REQUIRED)

| `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py` | Modified | Fixed is_root bypass for APE vetting edges; added `validate_ape_vetting_target()` |
| `app/vvp/keri/key_parser.py` | Modified | Added documentation for §4.2 single-sig AID enforcement |
| `tests/test_acdc.py` | Modified | Added 4 new tests for APE vetting validation, added `KNOWN_LE_SCHEMA` constant |
| `app/Documentation/VVP_Implementation_Checklist.md` | Modified | Phase 10 100% complete, overall 79% |

### Summary

Completed remaining MUST requirements in Phase 10 (Authorization Verification) per VVP spec §6.3.3, §4.2, and §6.3.5.

**Key Changes:**

1. **APE Vetting Edge Always Required (§6.3.3):**
   - Fixed `validate_edge_semantics()` to not skip required edge checks for APE credentials
   - Previous code allowed `is_root=True` to bypass vetting edge requirement
   - APE credentials MUST have vetting edge → LE credential, even when issued by trusted root

2. **APE Vetting Target Validation (§6.3.3, §6.3.5):**
   - Added `validate_ape_vetting_target()` function
   - Validates vetting target credential type is LE (not TNAlloc, DE, etc.)
   - Validates vetting LE credential uses known vLEI schema SAID
   - Respects `SCHEMA_VALIDATION_STRICT` config flag

3. **Single-Sig AID Documentation (§4.2):**
   - Added comprehensive documentation to `key_parser.py`
   - Only B/D prefixes accepted (Ed25519 single-sig codes)
   - Multi-sig AIDs (E, F, M prefixes) rejected
   - Item 10.18 already enforced, now documented

4. **Test Updates:**
   - Added `KNOWN_LE_SCHEMA` constant for test fixtures
   - Updated 4 existing tests to use known LE schema SAID
   - Added 4 new Sprint 17 tests for APE vetting validation

### Checklist Items Completed

- 10.12: APE must include vetting edge → LE credential
- 10.18: kid AID single-sig validation (already enforced, documented)

### Test Results

```
752 passed, 2 skipped in 4.89s

## Sprint 16: Delegation Authorization (Case B)

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `6e5387d`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/authorization.py` | Modified | Added `_find_delegation_target()`, `_verify_delegation_chain()` for Case B delegation |
| `tests/test_authorization.py` | Modified | Added 9 new tests for Case B delegation scenarios (45 total) |

### Summary

Implemented VVP Specification §5A Step 10 Case B: Delegation chain validation.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Delegation Chain Validation (Case B):**
   - `_find_delegation_target()`: Finds credential referenced by DE's delegation edge
   - `_verify_delegation_chain()`: Walks DE → APE chain to identify accountable party
   - DE issuee must match PASSporT signer (OP is delegate)
   - Chain terminates when APE credential reached
   - APE issuee is the accountable party (used for TN rights binding)

2. **Multi-Level Delegation:**
   - Supports nested delegation: DE → DE → ... → APE
   - Maximum chain depth of 10 (configurable)
   - Cycle detection prevents infinite loops

3. **Error Handling:**
   - No DE for signer → INVALID
   - Missing delegation target → INVALID
   - Circular delegation → INVALID
   - Chain too deep → INVALID

4. **TN Rights Binding:**
   - TNAlloc must be bound to accountable party (APE issuee), not delegate
   - Ensures proper authorization chain even with delegation

### Checklist Items Completed

- 10.5: Case B - verify delegation credential chain
- 10.14: If delegation, verify DE includes delegated signer credential
- 10.17: Verify OP is issuee of delegated signer credential

### Revision 1 (Review Fixes)

**Issues Addressed:**
- [High]: Case B selection now only uses delegation when DE issuee matches signer
- [Medium]: All matching DEs are tried; first valid chain wins

**Changes:**
- Refactored `_verify_delegation_chain()` into `_walk_de_chain()` + `_verify_delegation_chain()`
- `verify_party_authorization()` now filters DEs by issuee == signer before deciding Case B
- Unrelated DEs (issuee != signer) no longer force Case B; falls back to Case A

### Test Results

```
748 passed, 2 skipped in 4.77s
```

## Sprint 15: Authorization Verification (§5A Steps 10-11)

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `82c88a0`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/authorization.py` | Created | Authorization module with party authorization and TN rights validation (~265 lines) |
| `app/vvp/api_models.py` | Modified | Added `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED`, `TN_RIGHTS_INVALID` error codes |
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Wired `authorization_valid` claim into claim tree (~98 lines added) |
| `tests/test_authorization.py` | Created | 36 unit tests for authorization verification |
| `tests/vectors/data/v*.json` | Modified | Updated expected claim tree structure for authorization claims |
| `REVIEW.md` | Modified | Added Sprint 15 review records |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Sprint15.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Implemented VVP Specification §5A Steps 10-11: Party authorization and TN rights validation for Case A (no delegation).

**Key Changes:**

1. **Party Authorization (Step 10):**
   - `verify_party_authorization()` finds APE credential where issuee == PASSporT signer AID
   - Case A (no delegation): Direct match proves OP is accountable party
   - Case B (DE delegation): Returns INDETERMINATE (deferred to future sprint)
   - Error code: `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED`

2. **TN Rights Validation (Step 11):**
   - `verify_tn_rights()` validates orig.tn is covered by TNAlloc credential
   - **Binding requirement**: TNAlloc must be issued to the accountable party (issuee match)
   - When party authorization fails: TN rights returns INDETERMINATE (no party to bind to)
   - Uses existing `tn_utils.py` for E.164 parsing and subset validation
   - Error code: `TN_RIGHTS_INVALID`

3. **Claim Tree Structure:**
   ```
   caller_authorised
   ├── passport_verified (REQUIRED)
   ├── dossier_verified (REQUIRED)
   └── authorization_valid (REQUIRED)      ← NEW
       ├── party_authorized (REQUIRED)     ← NEW
       └── tn_rights_valid (REQUIRED)      ← NEW
   ```

4. **AuthorizationContext Dataclass:**
   - `pss_signer_aid`: AID extracted from PASSporT kid header
   - `orig_tn`: E.164 phone number from passport.payload.orig["tn"]
   - `dossier_acdcs`: All ACDC credentials parsed from the dossier

### Review History

- **Rev 0**: CHANGES_REQUESTED - TN rights not bound to accountable party
- **Rev 1**: APPROVED - Added `authorized_aid` parameter, TNAlloc issuee binding

### Checklist Items Completed

- 10.2: Extract originating party AID from PASSporT
- 10.4: Case A - verify orig = accountable (via APE issuee)
- 10.6: Locate TNAlloc in dossier
- 10.7: Compare orig field to TNAlloc credential (bound to accountable party)
- 10.9: Add caller_authorized claim to tree
- 10.10: Add tn_rights_valid claim to tree
- 10.11: Unit tests for authorization

### Test Results

```
737 passed, 2 skipped in 4.79s
```

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/acdc/schema_registry.py` | Created | Versioned schema SAID registry with vLEI governance sources |
| `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py` | Modified | Added `validate_edge_semantics()`, integrated into chain validation, strict schema validation |

| `tests/test_tn_utils.py` | Created | 15 tests for TN utilities |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase14.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Completed remaining Tier 2 ACDC validation requirements per spec §6.3.x and §1.4.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Schema SAID Validation (§6.3.x):**
   - `validate_schema_said()` now defaults to `strict=True`
   - Known LE schema SAIDs from vLEI governance framework
   - APE/DE/TNAlloc schemas accept any (pending governance publication)
   - Versioned registry in `schema_registry.py` with source documentation

2. **Edge Relationship Semantics (§6.3.3/§6.3.4/§6.3.6):**
   - `validate_edge_semantics()` validates credential type-specific edge rules
   - APE: MUST have vetting edge → LE credential
   - DE: MUST have delegation edge → APE or DE credential
   - TNAlloc: Should have JL edge → parent TNAlloc (unless root)
   - Integrated into `walk_chain()` for automatic enforcement
   - Missing required edge targets raise `ACDCChainInvalid`

3. **ACDC Variant Detection (§1.4 explicit handling):**
   - `detect_acdc_variant()` detects full, compact, and partial variants
   - Full variants: expanded `a` field present → accepted
   - Compact variants: missing/string `a` field → `ParseError`
   - Partial variants: `"_"` placeholders → `ParseError`
   - Documented non-compliance until full variant support implemented

4. **TNAlloc Phone Number Validation (§6.3.6):**
   - E.164 format validation with `+` prefix requirement
   - Wildcard support (`+1555*` → range expansion)
   - Hyphenated range parsing (`+15550000000-+15559999999`)
   - `is_subset()` validates child ranges covered by parent
   - Mixed list/range/dict inputs supported

### Checklist Items Completed

- 8.6: ACDC schema SAID validation (strict by default)
- 8.8: Edge/relationship semantic validation
- 8.9: ACDC variants (explicit rejection with documented non-compliance)
- 8.11: TNAlloc JL validation with phone number range subset

### Test Results

```
701 passed, 2 skipped, 20 warnings in 4.81s

## Phase 13B: Separation of Concerns Refactoring

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `dd95391`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/main.py` | Modified | Refactored `/ui/parse-jwt` to use domain layer `parse_passport()`, added permissive decode mode with spec reference mapping, removed dead code (`_base64url_decode`, `_parse_jwt_logic`, `_extract_acdcs_from_dossier`) |
| `app/vvp/dossier/parser.py` | Modified | Added Provenant wrapper format support (`{"details": "..."}`) and permissive CESR extraction fallback |
| `app/templates/partials/jwt_result.html` | Modified | Added validation warning display with spec section references in table format |
| `tests/test_ui_endpoints.py` | Created | 14 integration tests for UI endpoint behavior and domain layer alignment |
| `tests/test_dossier.py` | Modified | Added 2 tests for Provenant wrapper format parsing |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Modified | Added pre-authorization for pytest with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH |

### Summary

Phase 13B refactors the HTMX UI layer to properly delegate to the domain layer, fixing separation of concerns violations introduced in Phase 13.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Domain Layer Delegation (§5.0-5.2):**
   - `/ui/parse-jwt` now uses `parse_passport()` from `app/vvp/passport.py`
   - Removed duplicate base64url decoding and JWT parsing logic
   - Domain layer validation errors properly propagated to UI

2. **Permissive Decode Mode:**
   - JWT content shown even when validation fails
   - Validation errors displayed separately with "Validation Warning" banner
   - Spec section references mapped to error messages (20+ patterns)
   - Users can see decoded content and understand why validation failed

3. **Spec Reference Mapping:**
   - `SPEC_SECTION_MAP` dictionary maps error patterns to spec sections
   - Examples: `forbidden algorithm` → `§5.0, §5.1`, `orig.tn must be a single phone number` → `§4.2`
   - Template displays spec section and description alongside error message

4. **Provenant Dossier Format Support:**
   - Added handling for `{"details": "...CESR content..."}` wrapper format
   - Permissive CESR extraction when strict parsing fails (unknown attachment codes)
   - Filters KEL events from ACDCs using schema SAID format check
   - Deduplicates credentials by SAID

5. **Dead Code Removal:**
   - Deleted `_base64url_decode()` - replaced by domain layer
   - Deleted `_parse_jwt_logic()` - replaced by `parse_passport()`
   - Deleted `_extract_acdcs_from_dossier()` - no longer used

### Test Coverage

- 14 new UI endpoint integration tests
- 2 new Provenant wrapper format tests
- 621 total tests passing

## Phase 11: Tier 2 Integration & Compliance

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `b766b00`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Added Phase 5.5 chain_verified claim, Tier 2 PASSporT routing, ACDC chain validation integration, leaf credential selection |
| `app/vvp/keri/kel_resolver.py` | Modified | Added `strict_validation` parameter to `_fetch_and_validate_oobi()` for production vs test mode |
| `app/vvp/dossier/parser.py` | Modified | CESR format detection and signature extraction |
| `app/vvp/dossier/__init__.py` | Modified | Export signature dict from `parse_dossier()` |
| `app/core/config.py` | Modified | Added `SCHEMA_VALIDATION_STRICT` configuration flag |
| `tests/test_dossier.py` | Modified | Added CESR signature extraction test with mocking |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase11.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Integrated Tier 2 verification components into the main verification flow per spec §4.2, §5A Step 8, and §6.3.x.

**Key Changes:**

1. **ACDC Chain Validation Integration (§6.3.x):**
   - `chain_verified` claim added as REQUIRED child of `dossier_verified`
   - Chain validation starts from leaf credentials (APE/DE/TNAlloc), not just DAG root
   - `_find_leaf_credentials()` helper identifies credentials not referenced by edges
   - At least one leaf must validate to a trusted root

2. **Strict OOBI KEL Validation (§4.2):**
   - `_fetch_and_validate_oobi()` now accepts `strict_validation` parameter
   - Production mode: canonical KERI validation with SAID checks
   - Test mode: allows placeholder SAIDs and non-canonical serialization
   - ACDC signature verification uses strict key resolution

3. **PASSporT-Optional Chain Verification (§5A Step 8):**
   - Chain verification runs when dossier is present, even if PASSporT is absent
   - PSS signer binding for DE credentials only enforced when PASSporT available

4. **CESR Signature Extraction:**
   - Dossier parser detects CESR format and extracts controller signatures
   - Returns `Tuple[List[ACDCNode], Dict[str, bytes]]` with SAID→signature mapping
   - Signatures verified against issuer key state in production mode

5. **Schema Validation Configuration:**
   - `SCHEMA_VALIDATION_STRICT` flag (default True per spec)
   - False is a documented policy deviation for testing

**Spec Compliance:**
- §4.2: OOBI MUST resolve to valid KEL (enforced via strict validation)
- §5A Step 8: Dossier cryptographic verification MUST be performed
- §6.3.3-6: ACDC schema/credential type rules enforced from leaves

### Summary

Completed Tier 2 verification components: ACDC chain validation, CESR PSS signature decoding, OOBI KEL validation, and trusted root configuration.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Root of Trust Configuration (§5.1-7):**
   - `TRUSTED_ROOT_AIDS` frozenset from `VVP_TRUSTED_ROOT_AIDS` env var
   - Default: GLEIF External AID for production vLEI ecosystem
   - Supports multiple comma-separated roots

2. **PSS CESR Signature Decoding (§6.3.1):**
   - `decode_pss_signature()` handles 0A/0B/0C/0D/AA prefixed CESR signatures
   - Auto-detection in `_decode_signature()` with fallback to base64url

3. **OOBI KEL Validation (§4.2):**
   - `_fetch_and_validate_oobi()` validates KEL structure during resolution
   - Checks: KEL data present, inception event first, chain integrity

4. **ACDC Chain Validation (§6.3.x):**
   - `validate_credential_chain()` walks edges to trusted root
   - Credential type-specific validation: APE, DE, TNAlloc
   - `pss_signer_aid` parameter for DE signer binding per §6.3.4
   - Schema SAID validation against known vLEI governance schemas

5. **Lazy pysodium Import:**
   - Moved import inside functions to avoid load-time errors

**Spec Compliance:**
- §4.2: OOBI must resolve to valid KEL
- §5.1-7: Root of trust configuration
- §6.3.1: PSS CESR signature format
- §6.3.3: APE credential validation (vetting edge required)
- §6.3.4: DE credential validation (PSS signer must match delegate)
- §6.3.6: TNAlloc credential validation (TN subset of parent)

## Phase 9.4: TEL Resolution Architecture Fix

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Commit:** `4de5855`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/verify.py` | Modified | Added `_query_registry_tel()` helper, inline TEL parsing with latin-1 decoding, registry OOBI discovery |
| `app/vvp/keri/tel_client.py` | Modified | Added detailed logging to `parse_dossier_tel()` |
| `tests/test_revocation_checker.py` | Modified | Added 7 new tests for inline TEL, registry OOBI, binary-safe parsing |
| `app/main.py` | Modified | Added `POST /admin/log-level` endpoint for runtime log level changes |
| `tests/test_admin.py` | Modified | Added 6 tests for log level endpoint |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase9.4.md` | Created | Archived implementation plan |

### Summary

Fixed TEL resolution architecture so revocation checking works correctly instead of always returning INDETERMINATE.

**Problem:** The previous implementation queried the wrong endpoints (PASSporT signer's KERIA agent instead of registry witnesses), causing all TEL queries to return 404.

**Solution:**
1. **Inline TEL Parsing**: Check if TEL events are embedded in the raw dossier using binary-safe latin-1 decoding
2. **Registry OOBI Discovery**: Derive registry OOBI URL from base OOBI pattern (`{scheme}://{netloc}/oobi/{registry_said}`)
3. **Fallback Chain**: Inline TEL → Registry OOBI witnesses → Default witnesses

**Key Changes:**
- `check_dossier_revocations()` now accepts `raw_dossier` parameter for inline TEL parsing
- Latin-1 decoding preserves all byte values (byte-transparent) for CESR streams
- Evidence format standardized: `revocation_source:{dossier|witness}` with summary counts
- Runtime log level endpoint: `POST /admin/log-level` with `{"level": "DEBUG"}` body
- 440 tests passing (20 revocation tests)

**Spec Compliance:**
- §5.1.1-2.9: Revocation status checking via correct TEL sources
- §6.1B: Inline TEL events in CESR dossier format supported

---

| `tests/vectors/runner.py` | Modified | Added TEL client mock for deterministic tests |
| `app/Documentation/VVP_Implementation_Checklist.md` | Modified | Updated to v3.3, Phase 9 100% complete |

### Summary

Integrated revocation checking into the main verification flow per spec §5.1.1-2.9.

**Key Changes:**
- `revocation_clear` claim is now a REQUIRED child of `dossier_verified` per §3.3B
- `dossier_verified` status propagates from `revocation_clear` per §3.3A
- `CREDENTIAL_REVOKED` errors emitted for each revoked credential
- `/admin` endpoint exposes all configuration values (gated by `ADMIN_ENDPOINT_ENABLED`)
- INFO-level logging added to TEL client for debugging
- 480 tests passing (11 new revocation tests, 9 new admin tests)

**Spec Compliance:**
- §5.1.1-2.9: Revocation status checking for all ACDCs in dossier
- §3.3B: `revocation_clear` placed under `dossier_verified`
- §3.3A: Status propagation (INVALID > INDETERMINATE > VALID)

| `tests/test_canonicalization.py` | Created | Canonical ordering tests |
| `tests/fixtures/keri/*.json` | Created | Test fixtures from keripy |

### Summary

Integrated with Provenant staging witnesses for live KERI ecosystem testing.

**Key Changes:**
- CESR stream parsing for witness OOBI responses
- KERI-compliant field ordering for serialization
- TEL client infrastructure for revocation checking
- Provenant witness endpoints: witness4/5/6.stage.provenant.net:5631
- Verified live resolution with test AID `EGay5ufBqAanbhFa_qe-KMFUPJHn8J0MFba96yyWRrLF`

**Documentation:**
- Created ROADMAP.md with tier architecture overview
- Updated checklist to reflect implementation progress (60%)
- Archived old spec versions (v1.1, v1.2, v1.3)

### Normative Note: `kid` Field Semantics

Per VVP draft and KERI specifications:

> **`kid` is an OOBI reference to a KERI autonomous identifier whose historical key state, witness receipts, and delegations MUST be resolved and validated to determine which signing key was authorised at the PASSporT reference time.**

This means `kid` is NOT a generic JWT key ID - resolution requires OOBI dereferencing and KEL validation at reference time T.

| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase7.md` | Created | Archived phase plan |

### Summary

Implemented Tier 2 KERI key state resolution for historical key verification per VVP §5A Step 4 and §5D.

**Components:**
- OOBI dereferencer for fetching KEL data from witness endpoints
- KEL event parser with chain continuity and signature validation
- Key state resolver that determines signing keys valid at reference time T
- LRU cache keyed by (AID, establishment_digest) with time-based secondary index

**Feature Gating:**
- `TIER2_KEL_RESOLUTION_ENABLED = False` by default
- Tier 2 is TEST-ONLY due to limitations:
  - JSON-only (CESR binary format not supported)
  - Signature canonicalization uses JSON sorted-keys (not KERI-compliant Blake3)
  - SAID validation disabled by default
- Tests use `_allow_test_mode=True` to bypass feature gate

### Spec Sections Implemented

- §5A Step 4: Resolve issuer key state at reference time T
- §5C.2: Key state cache (AID + timestamp → rotation-sensitive)
- §5D: Historical verification capabilities

### Test Results

```
97 passed (Phase 7 tests)
368 passed, 2 skipped (full test suite)
```

## Phase 9: VVP Verifier Specification v1.5

**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Commit:** `953e694`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/Documentation/VVP_Verifier_Specification_v1.5.md` | Created | Complete verification algorithm specification |
| `app/Documentation/PLAN_Phase9.md` | Created | Archived plan for Phase 9 |

### Summary

Extended VVP_Verifier_Specification_v1.4_FINAL with complete verification algorithms per authoritative VVP draft §5.

**New Sections:**
- §3.3B: Complete claim tree structure for caller and callee verification
- §4.2A: 8 new error codes (CREDENTIAL_REVOKED, CONTEXT_MISMATCH, AUTHORIZATION_FAILED, TN_RIGHTS_INVALID, BRAND_CREDENTIAL_INVALID, GOAL_REJECTED, DIALOG_MISMATCH, ISSUER_MISMATCH)
- §4.4: SIP Context Fields normative section
- §5A: 13-step Caller Verification Algorithm per VVP §5.1
- §5B: 14-step Callee Verification Algorithm per VVP §5.2
- §5C: Efficiency and Caching guidance per VVP §5.3
- §5D: Historical Verification capabilities per VVP §5.4
- §9: Full pseudocode for caller and callee verification with explicit claim node initialization
- §10.2: Test vectors tiered by implementation phase (Tier 1/2/3)
- §12: Implementation Tiers (Tier 1/2/3)
- Appendix A: Spec §5 Traceability Matrix

**Key Design Decisions:**
- SIP context absence produces INDETERMINATE, not rejection (policy-driven)
- Replay tolerance (30s) distinguished from iat binding tolerance (5s)
- `issuer_matched` placed under `dossier_verified` in callee claim tree
- Step-to-claim mapping tables added to prevent drift

### Spec Sections Implemented

- VVP §5.1.1-2.1 through §5.1.1-2.13: Caller verification algorithm
- VVP §5.2-2.1 through §5.2-2.14: Callee verification algorithm
- VVP §5.3: Efficiency and caching
- VVP §5.4: Historical verification

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app/vvp/exceptions.py` | Modified | Added PassportError exception class |
| `app/vvp/passport.py` | Created | PASSporT JWT parser and validator per §5.0-§5.4 |
| `tests/test_passport.py` | Created | 68 unit tests for PASSporT parsing |

### Summary

- Created `PassportError` exception class with factory methods:
  - `missing()` → `PASSPORT_MISSING`
  - `parse_failed(reason)` → `PASSPORT_PARSE_FAILED` (binding violations, structure errors)
  - `forbidden_alg(alg)` → `PASSPORT_FORBIDDEN_ALG`
  - `expired(reason)` → `PASSPORT_EXPIRED` (actual expiry policy failures only)
- Created frozen dataclasses: `PassportHeader`, `PassportPayload`, `Passport`
- Implemented `parse_passport(jwt)` function:
  - JWT structure parsing (header.payload.signature)
  - Algorithm enforcement: accept EdDSA only, reject none/ES256/HMAC/RSA (§5.0, §5.1)
  - Header validation: require `alg`, `ppt`, `kid`; ignore `typ` (§5.2)
  - Payload validation: require `iat`, `orig`, `dest`, `evd` (local policy)
  - Support optional fields: `iss`, `exp`, `card`, `goal`, `call-reason`→`call_reason`, `origid`
  - Validate `ppt` = "vvp" per §5.2
- Implemented `validate_passport_binding(passport, vvp_identity, now)` function:
  - `ppt` binding: PASSporT ppt must match VVP-Identity ppt (§5.2)
  - `kid` binding: strict equality in Phase 3 (§5.2)
  - `iat` drift: ≤5 seconds between PASSporT and VVP-Identity (§5.2A)
  - `exp > iat` validation (§5.2A)
  - `exp` drift: ≤5 seconds when both present (§5.2A)
  - Expiry policy: max validity 300s, clock skew ±300s (§5.2B)
- Preserved raw header/payload and signature bytes for Phase 4 signature verification

### Error Code Usage

| Error Code | Used For |
|------------|----------|
| `PASSPORT_MISSING` | JWT is None or empty |
| `PASSPORT_PARSE_FAILED` | Malformed JWT, invalid base64/JSON, missing fields, binding violations (ppt/kid mismatch, iat drift, exp mismatch) |
| `PASSPORT_FORBIDDEN_ALG` | Algorithm not in allowed list (only EdDSA accepted) |
| `PASSPORT_EXPIRED` | Token expired, validity window exceeded, max-age exceeded |

### Spec Sections Implemented
