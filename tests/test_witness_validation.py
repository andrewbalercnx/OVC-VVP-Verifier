Tests for witness receipt signature validation.

These tests verify that witness signatures are properly validated against
the canonical event bytes, including:
- Valid signatures pass validation
- Invalid signatures fail validation
- Threshold enforcement (toad)
- Witness AID parsing (B-prefix non-transferable)
