# archive-plan.sh — Automates Phase 3 (Completion and Archival) of the pair programming workflow.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/archive-plan.sh <sprint-number> <title>
#
# Example:
#   ./scripts/archive-plan.sh 35 "Credential Issuance"
#
# Files (namespaced by sprint number for concurrent safety):
#   Plan file:    PLAN_Sprint<N>.md    → Documentation/archive/PLAN_Sprint<N>.md
#   Review file:  REVIEW_Sprint<N>.md  (deleted after archival)
#
# What it does:
#   1. Appends PLAN_Sprint<N>.md content to Documentation/PLAN_history.md under a sprint header
#   2. Moves PLAN_Sprint<N>.md to Documentation/archive/PLAN_Sprint<N>.md
#   3. Removes REVIEW_Sprint<N>.md
#   4. Prints a reminder to update CHANGES.md (left manual since it needs human-written summary)
