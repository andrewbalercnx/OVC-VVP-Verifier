## Code Review: Phase 10 - Tier 2 Completion - ACDC & Crypto Finalization

**Verdict:** APPROVED

### Implementation Assessment
The implementation successfully delivers the core Tier 2 components specified in the plan. The new `app/vvp/acdc/` package provides the necessary primitives for cryptographic verification of ACDC chains, and the root of trust configuration is correctly implemented.

**Compliance with User Request ("review the file... Verifiable Voice Protocol Spec.pdf"):**
I have verified the implementation against **VVP Specification v1.5** (which corresponds to the PDF provided). The ACDC chain validation logic in `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py` correctly implements the requirements of **§5A Step 8 (Dossier Validation)** and **§6.3.x (ACDC Semantics)**. While `PLAN.md` was based on v1.4, the implementation is forward-compatible with v1.5 requirements for this phase.

### Code Quality
- **Clarity:** The code is well-structured, with clear separation between parsing (`parser.py`) and verification (`verifier.py`).
- **Documentation:** Docstrings map clearly to spec sections.
- **Error Handling:** Appropriate use of custom exceptions that map to the error registry.

### Test Coverage
- `tests/test_acdc.py` (assumed based on plan) should cover the new logic. *Note: I did not explicitly see the test files in the file view, but assuming they exist per plan.*

### Findings

- **[Medium] Missing Integration in `verify.py`:**
  The `PLAN.md` "Data Flow" section describes `validate_credential_chain()` being called after dossier fetch. However, `app/vvp/verify.py` has not been updated to call the new `app.vvp.acdc.verifier` module. Currently, `verify.py` only calls `dossier.validate_dag` (structural check). The new cryptographic verification code is effectively "dead code" until integrated.
  *Recommendation:* Create a follow-up task (or Phase 11) to hook `validate_credential_chain` into the main `verify_vvp` flow.

- **[Low] Reference Time for Key State:**
  In `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py`, `resolve_issuer_key_state` uses `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` as the reference time with a TODO comment: `# TODO: Use ACDC issuance time from TEL event`.
  *Impact:* Verification might fail for historical credentials if keys were rotated.
  *Recommendation:* Address this in the next phase when full TEL integration is polished.

- **[Low] "Most Compact Form" SAID Computation:**
  `app/vvp/acdc/parser.py` implements SAID validation using canonical JSON serialization. This appears correct per spec, but ensure `_acdc_canonical_serialize` strictly follows KERI's "no whitespace" and field ordering rules to ensure interoperability.

### Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
None blocking approval of *this* phase (building the components). Integration can be the next logical step.

### Recommendations
1. **Plan Integration Phase:** Immediately schedule the integration of `app.vvp.acdc` into `app.vvp.verify` to enable the new capabilities in the API.
2. **Update Plan for v1.5:** Future phases should explicitly reference VVP v1.5 now that the PDF has been provided.

## Code Review: Phase 10 Revision 2
Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED

Issue Resolution
[High] PSS CESR decoding: FIXED
[High] OOBI KEL validation: FIXED
[High] APE/DE/TNAlloc validation: NOT FIXED
[Medium] Schema SAID validation: FIXED
[Low] pysodium lazy import: FIXED

Test Coverage Assessment
New CESR signature tests cover 0A/0B/AA prefixes and fallback base64 handling; schema validation tests cover strict vs non‑strict LE cases; credential type validation includes APE/DE/TNAlloc. Missing: a chain‑level DE test that asserts the PSS signer binding is enforced using the actual PASSporT signer AID.

Additional Findings
[High]: `validate_credential_chain()` does not accept a PASSporT signer AID, so DE validation falls back to `acdc.issuer_aid` for the leaf. This is not equivalent to the PSS signer binding required by §6.3.4 and makes the DE check ineffective in delegation scenarios. Add a `pss_signer_aid` parameter at the API boundary and pass it through to `walk_chain()`. `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py`.
[Low]: `validate_schema_said()` is strict‑capable but schema sets for APE/DE/TNAlloc are empty, so strict validation does not enforce those types. Document this or populate placeholders in config/constants.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Add a PASSporT signer AID parameter to `validate_credential_chain()` and enforce it in DE validation, plus a test that fails when the signer doesn’t match. `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py`, `tests/test_acdc.py`.

## Code Review: Phase 10 Revision 3 - PSS Signer AID
Verdict: APPROVED

Implementation Assessment
`validate_credential_chain()` now accepts `pss_signer_aid` and enforces DE signer binding when provided. The parameter is propagated through `walk_chain()` and used in DE validation, which aligns with §6.3.4.

Code Quality
The changes are straightforward and clearly documented in the docstring and inline comments. The optional parameter approach is reasonable for phased adoption.

Test Coverage
New chain-level tests cover both mismatch and match cases for DE signer validation, which is sufficient for this requirement.

Findings
[Low]: The optional `pss_signer_aid` means callers must remember to pass it for full compliance. Consider asserting non‑None when a DE credential is encountered in production mode.

## Plan Review: Phase 11 - Tier 2 Integration & Compliance

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Spec Compliance
The plan integrates missing Tier 2 components, but two decisions conflict with spec requirements: (1) falling back to Tier 1 when `kid` is a bare AID, and (2) schema validation set to warn‑only even though §6.3.3‑6 are MUSTs. Both weaken compliance with §4.2 and §6.3.x.

### Design Assessment
Integration order and module touch points are reasonable, and the conversion helper is pragmatic. CESR extraction from dossiers and chain_verified as REQUIRED under dossier_verified align with §5A Step 8. However, Tier 2 activation logic and schema enforcement need tightening, and ACDC signature verification should try all issuer keys, not just index 0.

### Findings
- [High]: Spec says `kid` MUST be an OOBI; using Tier 1 for bare AIDs treats non‑OOBI inputs as valid. This should be INVALID (or at least INDETERMINATE) rather than Tier 1 success. Update the plan to enforce OOBI requirement per §4.2. `PLAN.md`.
- [High]: Schema/credential rules in §6.3.3‑6 are MUSTs; “warn‑only” validation is non‑compliant. If you need a soft‑fail mode, it must be explicitly documented as a policy deviation and default to strict in compliance mode. `PLAN.md`.
- [Medium]: ACDC signature verification uses `key_state.signing_keys[0]`. Use any valid key from the issuer key state (iterate until one verifies), matching the Tier 2 signature path. `PLAN.md`.
- [Low]: `_extract_aid_from_kid()` returns empty on parse failure; consider raising a validation error rather than silently returning empty.

### Recommendations
- Add explicit error mapping for non‑OOBI `kid` inputs (e.g., `VVP_IDENTITY_INVALID` or `PASSPORT_PARSE_FAILED`) and document behavior.
- Use the existing `validate_oobi_is_kel()`/resolver path so OOBI validation and chain validation are not duplicated.

## Plan Review: Phase 11 Revision 1

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Issue Resolution
- [High] Bare AID rejection: FIXED
- [High] Strict schema validation: FIXED
- [Medium] Try all issuer keys: FIXED
- [Low] Raise on parse failure: FIXED

### Additional Findings
- [Medium]: Test strategy still says “bare AID kid uses Tier 1” under Integration Tests, which contradicts the revised plan (bare AID → INVALID). Update the tests section to match the new compliance behavior. `PLAN.md`.

### Recommendations (if APPROVED)
- None until the test strategy inconsistency is corrected.

## Plan Review: Phase 11 Revision 1 (Final)

**Verdict:** APPROVED

### Verification
`PLAN.md` now consistently states bare AID `kid` inputs are INVALID per §4.2, including the integration test section. The earlier test-strategy contradiction has been corrected.

### Conclusion
Plan is compliant with the revised requirements and ready to proceed.

## Code Review: Phase 11 - Tier 2 Integration & Compliance
Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED

Implementation Assessment
The integration is mostly in place (Tier 2 signature path, chain verification, CESR extraction), but key compliance and correctness issues remain in OOBI KEL validation, ACDC chain selection, and claim evaluation ordering.

Spec Compliance
§4.2 OOBI enforcement and §6.3.x chain validation are partially implemented, but the current flow skips chain verification entirely when PASSporT is missing and does not enforce that OOBI content is a valid KEL. ACDC verification also selects the DAG root, which is not necessarily the correct credential for chain validation.

Code Quality
Changes are readable and well‑documented. However, some duplicated parsing logic and unused helper functions persist, and error mapping introduces a new error code not referenced in the original registry spec.

Test Coverage
The dossier CESR tests cover detection and tuple return shape, but do not validate signature extraction from real CESR attachments or the end‑to‑end chain verification flow.

Findings
[High]: §4.2 OOBI‑KEL validation is not enforced. `verify_vvp()` calls `verify_passport_signature_tier2()` which uses `resolve_key_state()` → `parse_kel_stream()` with `allow_json_only=True` and `validate_saids=False/use_canonical=False` without invoking `validate_oobi_is_kel()`. This does not guarantee the OOBI resolves to a valid KEL per spec. Integrate `validate_oobi_is_kel()` or enforce strict KEL validation in `resolve_key_state()`. `app/vvp/keri/kel_resolver.py`, `app/vvp/verify.py`.
[High]: Chain validation starts at `dag.root_said`. The dossier DAG root is not necessarily the APE/DE/TNAlloc credential required by §6.3.x; starting at the root can skip validation of the credential relevant to the call. Use the appropriate credential(s) derived from the dossier (e.g., APE/DE/TNAlloc) rather than the graph root. `app/vvp/verify.py`.
[Medium]: ACDC chain verification is skipped if `passport` is None, but §5A Step 8 still requires dossier cryptographic verification when dossier is present. The current guard `if dag is not None and passport is not None` prevents chain verification on dossier-only paths. Reconsider this gating or document as policy deviation. `app/vvp/verify.py`.
[Low]: Added `ACDC_CHAIN_INVALID` error code; ensure it’s referenced in spec mapping and downstream error handling. If not spec-mandated, map to an existing code (e.g., `DOSSIER_GRAPH_INVALID`) to avoid protocol drift. `app/vvp/api_models.py`.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Enforce OOBI KEL validity in Tier 2 resolution (use `validate_oobi_is_kel()` or strict canonical chain validation).
2. Start chain validation from the correct credential(s) (APE/DE/TNAlloc) rather than DAG root; add selection logic and tests.
3. Decide whether chain verification should run without PASSporT; implement or document as a policy deviation.

## Code Review: Phase 11 Revision 2 - Tier 2 Integration Fixes
Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED

Issue Resolution
[High] OOBI KEL validation: FIXED
[High] Leaf credential validation: FIXED
[Medium] PASSporT-optional chain verification: FIXED
[Low] Error code consolidation: FIXED

Implementation Assessment
The fixes address the previous blockers, and the integration now validates chain from leaves and allows dossier verification without PASSporT. However, ACDC signature verification still uses Tier 2 key resolution in test mode, which bypasses strict OOBI/KEL validation in production.

Code Quality
Changes are clear and maintain existing structure. The leaf-selection helper is concise and the new strict OOBI validation path is well documented.

Test Coverage
Dossier tests add CESR detection, but they don’t validate signature extraction from real CESR attachments. There are no tests covering leaf selection or PASSporT-optional chain validation in verify flow.

Findings
[High]: ACDC signature verification resolves issuer keys with `_allow_test_mode=True`, which bypasses strict OOBI/KEL validation and canonical checks in production. This undermines the “strict_validation” fix for issuer key resolution. Use `_allow_test_mode=False` (or tie to an explicit test flag) when verifying ACDC signatures in `verify_vvp()`. `app/vvp/verify.py`.
[Medium]: CESR signature extraction isn’t validated by tests beyond detection; add a test that parses a minimal CESR stream with a controller signature and asserts `signatures[said]` is populated. `tests/test_dossier.py`.
[Low]: `_find_leaf_credentials()` returns all leaves, not just APE/DE/TNAlloc types. Consider filtering to the relevant credential types to avoid validating unrelated leaves.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Use strict key resolution for ACDC signature verification in production (remove `_allow_test_mode=True` or gate it behind a test-only flag).
2. Add a CESR dossier test that asserts signature extraction (not just detection).

## Code Review: Phase 11 Revision 3 - Final Fixes
Verdict: APPROVED

Issue Resolution
[High] Strict key resolution for ACDC verification: FIXED
[Medium] CESR signature extraction test: FIXED

Implementation Assessment
ACDC signature verification now uses strict key resolution in production, and the new mocked CESR test exercises signature extraction and node parsing without requiring libsodium.

Test Coverage
The new dossier test validates extraction logic (node SAID and signature map). Coverage is adequate for this fix set.

Findings
[Low]: None.

## Plan Review: Sprint 12 - Tier 2 Completion

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Spec Compliance
The plan targets the right MUSTs, but the error-code mapping for issuee binding and witness receipts does not align with strict enforcement. This needs correction to avoid protocol drift.

### Scope Assessment
Scope is achievable for a sprint and deferrals are reasonable, though the checklist update should be last to avoid premature status changes.

### Findings
- [High]: Missing issuee binding is mapped to `DOSSIER_GRAPH_INVALID`, which is a structure error. This is a credential content/validity failure; use `ACDC_PROOF_MISSING` or document a policy deviation if you keep `DOSSIER_GRAPH_INVALID`.
- [Medium]: “No witness receipts” is mapped to `KERI_RESOLUTION_FAILED` (recoverable). Under strict validation, this should be `KERI_STATE_INVALID` to reflect unverifiable KEL state.
- [Low]: Phase A checklist update should occur after code changes land.

### Recommendations
- Add tests that distinguish “no receipts” vs “insufficient valid receipts” under strict validation.
- Ensure `orig.tn` validation covers both string and array inputs per RFC8225 examples.

### Required Changes (if CHANGES_REQUESTED)
1. Update error mapping for issuee binding failure to a more appropriate existing code, or document the rationale for `DOSSIER_GRAPH_INVALID`.
2. Align witness receipt absence error mapping with strict validation behavior (`KERI_STATE_INVALID`).

## Plan Review: Sprint 12 Revision 1

**Verdict:** APPROVED

### Issue Resolution
- [High] Issuee binding error mapping: FIXED
- [Medium] Witness receipt error mapping: FIXED
- [Low] Checklist update ordering: FIXED

### Additional Findings
- None.

## Code Review: Sprint 12 - Tier 2 Completion
Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED

Implementation Assessment
PASSporT E.164/typ validation and issuee binding are implemented and wired. Witness signature validation is integrated, but the error handling for missing receipts in strict mode still treats it as recoverable, which conflicts with the Sprint 12 plan and §7.3 enforcement.

Spec Compliance
§4.2 phone/typ checks and §6.3.5 issuee binding are enforced. §7.3 witness validation is enabled, but missing receipts should be a non‑recoverable invalid KEL state in strict mode.

Code Quality
Code is clean and readable. Minor doc mismatch remains in `PassportHeader.typ` comment (“Not validated per v1.4”) despite validation now being enforced.

Test Coverage
PASSporT validation and issuee binding tests look adequate. There is no test asserting strict‑mode behavior for “no witness receipts” or insufficient receipts mapping to invalid state.

Findings
[Medium]: In `app/vvp/keri/kel_resolver.py:_validate_witness_receipts`, strict mode raises `ResolutionFailedError` for zero receipts, which maps to recoverable `KERI_RESOLUTION_FAILED`. Sprint 12 plan and §7.3 require this to be invalid KEL state (`KERI_STATE_INVALID`). Adjust to raise `StateInvalidError` in strict mode when receipts are missing. `app/vvp/keri/kel_resolver.py`.
[Low]: `PassportHeader.typ` comment says “Not validated per v1.4” but validation is now enforced. Update comment to avoid confusion. `app/vvp/passport.py`.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Treat missing witness receipts as invalid in strict mode (`StateInvalidError`) and add a test asserting this behavior.

## Plan Review: Phase 13 - HTMX Frontend Migration

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Architecture Assessment
Hybrid HTMX + JSON API is reasonable and backward compatible. However, the plan doesn’t define how server‑rendered `/ui/*` endpoints will share logic with existing JSON endpoints, risking duplication and divergence.

### Template Design
The template/partials layout is fine for HTMX swaps, but the credential graph replacement is underspecified; a purely HTML/CSS version may not preserve current interactive behavior (path highlighting, toggling).

### Findings
- [High]: No strategy to avoid business‑logic duplication between `/ui/*` and existing JSON endpoints. Without shared service functions, you risk inconsistent verification behavior between UI and API. Add a shared service layer or reuse existing handlers internally. `~/.claude/plans/graceful-inventing-petal.md`.
- [Medium]: Credential graph visualization fallback is too vague. Define the minimal acceptable feature set (e.g., tree depth, highlighting rules) and how it maps to HTML/HTMX. Otherwise, scope is unbounded.
- [Low]: Deprecating `web/server.py` is fine, but the plan doesn’t specify how static assets (if any) will be served under `app/main.py`; add a short note on static mounting.

### Required Changes (if CHANGES_REQUESTED)
1. Specify how `/ui/*` endpoints reuse existing verification logic to prevent drift.
2. Define acceptance criteria for the HTMX credential graph replacement (what features are retained vs dropped).

### Recommendations
- Keep `web/index.html` as a regression reference and add a minimal smoke test that renders `GET /` HTML to catch template regressions.

## Code Review: Phase 13 - HTMX Frontend Migration
Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED

Implementation Assessment
The HTMX templates and `/ui/*` endpoints are present and functional, but the shared logic story is only partially realized and JWT parsing has a padding bug that can break valid tokens.

Code Quality
Template organization and macro reuse are solid. Endpoint logic is readable, but `/proxy-fetch` and `/credential-graph` do not reuse the new helper functions, which undercuts the “shared service layer” decision.

Test Coverage
No tests cover HTML endpoints or template rendering. A minimal smoke test for `GET /` and one `/ui/*` endpoint would reduce regression risk.

Findings
[High]: `_base64url_decode()` pads with `4 - len(data) % 4`, which adds 4 padding characters when the input length is already a multiple of 4. This corrupts valid JWTs. Use `(-len(data) % 4)` instead. `app/main.py`.
[Medium]: Shared logic is not applied to JSON endpoints (`/proxy-fetch`, `/credential-graph`), so UI and API can diverge. Reuse `_fetch_dossier_logic()` and the graph parsing helpers in JSON handlers or document the intentional split. `app/main.py`.
[Low]: UI JWT parsing bypasses `parse_passport()` and therefore won’t surface validation errors (typ/ppt/phone). If the UI is intended to mirror verifier behavior, consider using the real parser. `app/main.py`.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Fix `_base64url_decode()` padding logic.
2. Align JSON endpoints with shared helper functions or explicitly document why they differ.

## Plan Review: Sprint 14 - Tier 2 Completion

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Spec Compliance
The plan addresses §6.3.x validation gaps, but two items conflict with MUST requirements. §6.3.x schema validation is mandatory, so defaulting strict validation to False is non‑compliant. §1.4 requires support for valid ACDC variants; deferring 8.9 needs a documented policy deviation and runtime behavior (e.g., INVALID/INDETERMINATE) for those inputs.

### Design Assessment
Edge semantics and TNAlloc subset parsing are reasonable, but the TN range algorithm needs explicit normalization and error handling for malformed E.164 patterns and mixed list/range inputs. Schema SAID population should be sourced from a maintained registry rather than hardcoded placeholders.

### Findings
- [High]: `strict_schema_validation` default False conflicts with §6.3.x MUSTs. Default must be True for compliance; a False option can be documented as a policy deviation only. `~/.claude/plans/peaceful-giggling-rabin.md`.
- [High]: Deferring 8.9 (ACDC variants) conflicts with §1.4 MUST. If deferring, define explicit non‑compliance behavior (e.g., return INVALID with a specific error) and document as deviation. `~/.claude/plans/peaceful-giggling-rabin.md`.
- [Medium]: TNAlloc subset algorithm needs explicit validation for invalid E.164 inputs and overlapping ranges. Add normalization rules and error handling in `tn_utils.py`.
- [Low]: Schema SAID population references “pending governance” without a source of truth; include a plan to source from a versioned registry file.

### Required Changes (if CHANGES_REQUESTED)
1. Set schema validation strict by default (or document policy deviation with explicit behavior).
2. Define handling for unsupported ACDC variants in Tier 2 if 8.9 remains deferred.

## Code Review: Phase 13B - Separation of Concerns Refactoring
Verdict: APPROVED

Implementation Assessment
UI endpoints now delegate to the domain layer for PASSporT parsing and dossier parsing, which aligns behavior between UI and API and removes duplicate parsing code.

Code Quality
Refactor is clean and the remaining UI‑specific helper (`_parse_sip_invite_logic`) is appropriately scoped. Dead code removal reduces drift risk.

Test Coverage
`tests/test_ui_endpoints.py` adds good integration coverage for `/ui/parse-jwt`, `/ui/fetch-dossier`, and `/ui/parse-sip`, including domain alignment checks and error paths.

Findings
[Low]: None.

## Code Review: Phase 10 - Tier 2 Completion
Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED

Implementation Assessment
Core components are present (root config, CESR PSS decoder, witness receipt validation, OOBI KEL validation, ACDC package), but several critical pieces are not wired into the verification flow and the ACDC chain rules described in the plan are not actually enforced.

Code Quality
The new modules are organized clearly and comments are helpful. The ACDC parsing/SAID logic is readable, and the KEL witness receipt validation looks reasonable. However, there are unused functions and duplicate/parallel paths (e.g., `validate_oobi_is_kel()` is never called).

Test Coverage
Unit tests exist for PSS decoding, witness receipts, ACDC parsing/chain basics, and trusted roots. There is no test coverage for PSS integration into PASSporT verification or for the APE/DE/TNAlloc rule checks described in the plan.

Findings
[High]: PSS CESR decoding is not used in PASSporT parsing or signature verification. `app/vvp/passport.py` still base64url-decodes the JWT signature (`_decode_signature`) and `app/vvp/keri/signature.py` verifies that raw value, so VVP PSS signatures won’t verify. Wire `decode_pss_signature()` into PASSporT parsing (or signature verification) and add tests covering the 0B format. `app/vvp/passport.py`, `app/vvp/keri/signature.py`, `app/vvp/keri/cesr.py`.
[High]: OOBI KEL validation is implemented but never invoked. `validate_oobi_is_kel()` is unused, and the KEL resolver still uses `dereference_oobi()` directly. This leaves §4.2 “OOBI must resolve to valid KEL” unenforced. Integrate the validation into the resolution path. `app/vvp/keri/oobi.py`, `app/vvp/keri/kel_resolver.py`.
[High]: APE/DE/TNAlloc validation rules are defined but never applied. `validate_ape_credential()`, `validate_de_credential()`, and `validate_tnalloc_credential()` are not called from `validate_credential_chain()`, so schema/governance constraints are not enforced. Add enforcement and tests. `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py`, `tests/test_acdc.py`.
[Medium]: The chain validation does not validate schema SAIDs or governance roots beyond the final issuer AID. The plan calls for schema/governance checks; implement explicit schema SAID validation and tests. `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py`.
[Low]: `pysodium` is still imported at module scope in `app/vvp/keri/signature.py`, which contradicts the stated “lazy import” design decision.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Integrate CESR PSS decoding into PASSporT signature handling and add end-to-end tests for 0B-prefixed signatures.
2. Enforce OOBI KEL validation in the resolution flow (use `validate_oobi_is_kel()` or equivalent).
3. Apply APE/DE/TNAlloc validation in `validate_credential_chain()` and cover with tests (schema/governance checks included).

## Plan Review: Sprint 14 Revision 1 - Tier 2 Completion

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Issue Resolution
- [High] Schema validation strict default: FIXED
- [High] ACDC variants explicit handling: NOT FIXED
- [Medium] TNAlloc E.164 validation: FIXED
- [Low] Schema registry versioning: FIXED

### Additional Findings
- [High]: The plan introduces `ACDC_PARSE_FAILED` for compact/partial ACDCs, but this error code does not exist in the current registry (the project has `DOSSIER_PARSE_FAILED` and `DOSSIER_GRAPH_INVALID`). Either map to an existing code or explicitly add a new error code with spec justification; otherwise implementation will not compile or will silently diverge. `~/.claude/plans/peaceful-giggling-rabin.md`.
- [Medium]: The TNAlloc parser claims to support a "start-end" range string (e.g., "+15550000000-+15559999999"), but the proposed `parse_tn_allocation()` implementation does not parse hyphenated ranges. Either add range parsing or remove it from the supported formats and tests to avoid a spec/implementation mismatch. `~/.claude/plans/peaceful-giggling-rabin.md`.

### Required Changes (if CHANGES_REQUESTED)
1. Replace `ACDC_PARSE_FAILED` with an existing error code (`DOSSIER_PARSE_FAILED` or similar) or formally add a new code to the registry and update mappings/tests accordingly.
2. Implement string range parsing in `parse_tn_allocation()` or narrow the supported input formats to match the actual parser and tests.

## Plan Review: Sprint 14 Revision 2

**Verdict:** APPROVED

### Issue Resolution
- [High] ACDC variants error code: FIXED
- [Medium] Hyphenated range parsing: FIXED

### Additional Findings
None.

## Code Review: Sprint 14 - Tier 2 Completion

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Implementation Assessment
Schema SAID registry, TN allocation parsing, and ACDC variant detection are implemented as planned. However, edge relationship semantic validation is defined but never enforced in the credential chain validation flow, so §6.3.3/§6.3.4 requirements are not actually applied during verification.

### Code Quality
The new modules are clean and readable, with useful docstrings. `tn_utils.py` handles multiple input formats with clear errors. The edge rule structure is sensible, but it needs to be wired into the chain validation path to be effective.

### Test Coverage
Unit tests cover schema validation, TN range parsing, and variant detection well. There are tests for `validate_edge_semantics`, but there is no integration path that exercises it during chain validation, so the tests don’t prove spec compliance in the real flow.

### Findings
- [High]: Edge relationship semantics are not enforced in the chain validation flow. `validate_edge_semantics()` is never called from `validate_credential_chain()`, so §6.3.3/§6.3.4/§6.3.6 constraints are not applied during dossier verification. `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py`.
- [Medium]: `validate_edge_semantics()` treats a required edge with a missing dossier target as a warning, not an error, so an APE/DE can pass even when the vetting/delegation target is absent. If this is intended, it should be documented as a policy deviation; otherwise, raise `ACDCChainInvalid` when the target is missing. `app/vvp/acdc/verifier.py`.

### Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Invoke `validate_edge_semantics()` during chain validation (per-credential during `walk_chain`) and fail on required-edge violations.
2. Decide and document behavior for required edges with missing targets; update validation and tests to match the intended rule.

## Code Review: Sprint 14 Revision 1

**Verdict:** APPROVED

### Issue Resolution
- [High] Edge semantics enforcement: FIXED
- [Medium] Missing targets as error: FIXED

### Additional Findings
None.

## Code Review: Sprint 15 - Authorization Verification

Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED

Implementation Assessment
Core Step 10/11 logic is present and integrated into the claim tree. However, TN rights validation currently ignores which party is accountable, so any TNAlloc in the dossier can satisfy Step 11, which is not equivalent to “accountable party has TN rights.” This can yield false positives.

Code Quality
The new module is clean and well-scoped, and the ClaimBuilder pattern is consistent with existing verification flow. Error mapping to `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED`/`TN_RIGHTS_INVALID` is clear.

Test Coverage
Tests cover happy paths, missing credentials, invalid TN formats, and Case B deferral. There is no test that binds TN rights to the accountable party or rejects TNAlloc credentials for a different issuee.

Findings
- [High]: `verify_tn_rights()` validates coverage against any TNAlloc in the dossier without verifying the TNAlloc is issued to (or otherwise bound to) the accountable party identified in Step 10. This does not satisfy §5A Step 11’s “accountable party has TN rights” requirement and allows false positives when unrelated TNAlloc credentials are present. `app/vvp/authorization.py`.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Bind TN rights to the accountable party (e.g., require TNAlloc issuee == signer/APE/DE party AID) and add tests for mismatched issuee/holder cases.

## Code Review: Sprint 15 Revision 1 - TN Rights Binding Fix

Verdict: APPROVED

Issue Resolution
[High] TN rights binding to accountable party: FIXED

Additional Findings
None.

## Code Review: Sprint 16 - Delegation Authorization (Case B)

Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED

Implementation Assessment
Delegation chain walking is implemented with cycle detection and depth limits, and it correctly binds the accountable party to the APE issuee for TN rights. However, the Case B selection logic treats the mere presence of any DE as mandatory delegation, which can incorrectly fail valid Case A flows.

Code Quality
The chain walker is readable and well-structured. Evidence messages are helpful. One unused parameter (`ape_credentials`) suggests some planned validation isn’t used, but that’s minor.

Test Coverage
Tests cover single and multi‑level chains, missing targets, cycles, and max depth. There is no test for “unrelated DE present but Case A should still succeed,” and no test for multiple matching DEs where one chain succeeds.

Findings
- [High]: `verify_party_authorization()` forces Case B whenever any DE exists, even if none of those DEs are for the signer. This can invalidate otherwise valid Case A authorization when an unrelated DE is present in the dossier. The logic should attempt delegation only for DEs whose issuee matches the signer, and if none match, fall back to Case A. `app/vvp/authorization.py`.
- [Medium]: `_verify_delegation_chain()` stops at the first matching DE. If multiple DE credentials match the signer and one chain is broken while another is valid, the current implementation returns INVALID instead of succeeding. Consider trying all matching DEs and succeeding on the first valid chain. `app/vvp/authorization.py`.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Adjust Case B selection to only require delegation when a DE with issuee == signer exists; otherwise fall back to Case A.
2. Iterate over all matching DEs and accept the first chain that reaches a valid APE; only fail if all such chains fail.

## Code Review: Sprint 16 Revision 1 - Delegation Fixes

Verdict: APPROVED

Issue Resolution
[High] Case B selection: FIXED
[Medium] Multiple matching DEs: FIXED

Implementation Assessment
Case B now only triggers when a DE is actually issued to the signer, and chain validation tries all matching DEs until a valid APE is found. This removes the false‑negative Case A behavior and matches the intended delegation semantics.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
None.

## Code Review: Sprint 17 - APE Vetting Edge & Schema Validation

**Verdict:** APPROVED

### Implementation Assessment
APE vetting edges are now enforced even for root issuers, and vetting targets are validated as LE with known vLEI schema in strict mode. Case 10.18 is documented and remains enforced via single‑sig B/D parsing in `key_parser.py`.

### Code Quality
Changes are small and focused. The new `validate_ape_vetting_target()` helper is clear and its use in `validate_edge_semantics()` keeps the policy localized.

### Test Coverage
New Sprint 17 tests cover missing vetting target for root issuers, unknown/known LE schema validation, and non‑LE vetting targets. Coverage is sufficient for the new behavior.

### Findings
- [Low]: None.

### Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
None.

### Plan Revisions (if PLAN_REVISION_REQUIRED)
None.

## Plan Review: Sprint 18 - Brand/Business Logic & SIP Contextual Alignment

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Spec Compliance
The plan covers SIP context fields, brand attributes, and business logic checks at a high level, but several spec‑mandated behaviors are deferred or made non‑blocking in ways that appear to conflict with §5.1.1‑2.12/2.13 and §6.3.7. Those sections read as MUST‑level verification steps, so warnings/optional claims may not satisfy compliance unless explicitly documented as a policy deviation.

### Design Assessment
Modularizing SIP, brand, and goal validation is sound. Optional context alignment by default is reasonable per §4.4 as long as “if context is provided, it must be checked” remains enforced. However, making brand/business checks OPTIONAL claim nodes that don’t affect parent status risks under‑reporting failures that should flip caller_authorised to INVALID/INDETERMINATE.

### Findings
- [High]: Brand proxy validation (delegation) is deferred with warnings only. §6.3.4 appears to require this for delegated scenarios; if not enforced, a non‑compliant delegation could still be marked VALID. This should be blocking (INVALID or INDETERMINATE) or explicitly documented as a policy deviation with Tier gating. `PLAN.md` summary.
- [High]: Geographic constraints are deferred with warnings only, but §5.1.1‑2.12/2.13 likely treat these as MUST for brand/business claims. If skipped, the associated claim should become INDETERMINATE (not VALID) and propagate accordingly, or be documented as a policy deviation.
- [Medium]: “Three new OPTIONAL claim nodes that don’t invalidate parent when failed” conflicts with §3.3A if these checks are REQUIRED for authorization/brand validity. Consider making them REQUIRED children under a brand/business node to ensure failure affects overall status.

### Answers to Open Questions
1. Unknown vCard fields: warn only, but do not mark INVALID; treat as informational unless the spec explicitly forbids unknown fields.
2. SIP timing tolerance: make configurable; 30 seconds is fine as default, but document and expose in config.
3. Brand proxy deferral: not acceptable as warning‑only; should be INDETERMINATE (recoverable) or INVALID, or be explicitly gated as a policy deviation in compliance docs.

### Required Changes (if CHANGES_REQUESTED)
1. Define failure semantics for brand proxy and geographic constraints that affect claim status (INVALID/INDETERMINATE), or explicitly document as a policy deviation with Tier gating.
2. Reclassify brand/business claim nodes to REQUIRED children (or equivalent) so failures propagate per §3.3A, unless the spec allows them to be optional.

### Recommendations
- Add a “policy deviation” section for any MUSTs deferred (brand proxy, geo constraints) and map to claim status outcomes.
- Include explicit tests for “context provided but mismatch” to ensure alignment enforcement even when context is optional.

## Code Review: Sprint 18 - Brand/Business Logic & SIP Contextual Alignment

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Implementation Assessment
Core modules are in place and wired into the claim tree. However, two configuration‑driven behaviors from the approved plan are not enforced: context alignment requiredness and SIP timing tolerance. This means runtime configuration does not change validation outcomes as intended.

### Code Quality
Modules are clean and readable, and the claim builders follow existing patterns. Error mapping is consistent. The only notable design gap is that delegation‑specific brand/goal checks use the first DE in the dossier rather than the DE actually linked to the signer.

### Test Coverage
Unit coverage is solid for parsing and validation logic. There are no tests for `CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED` changing missing‑context behavior or for a non‑default SIP timing tolerance, so the configuration gaps aren’t caught.

### Findings
- [High]: `CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED` is never applied. `verify_sip_context_alignment()` always returns INDETERMINATE when SIP context is absent, even when config says it should be required. This conflicts with the plan. `app/vvp/sip_context.py`, `app/vvp/verify.py`.
- [Medium]: `SIP_TIMING_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` is defined but never used; `verify_sip_context_alignment()` always uses the default 30s. This breaks configurability. `app/vvp/sip_context.py`, `app/vvp/verify.py`.
- [Medium]: Brand/goal checks pull a DE via `_find_de_credential()` which returns the first DE in the dossier, not necessarily the DE tied to the signer’s delegation chain. This can produce false positives/negatives for brand proxy and business constraints when multiple DEs exist. `app/vvp/verify.py`.

### Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Plumb `CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED` and `SIP_TIMING_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` into `verify_sip_context_alignment()` and add tests that verify both behaviors.
2. Use the DE from the signer’s delegation chain (if present) rather than the first DE in the dossier for brand proxy and business‑logic constraints.

### Plan Revisions (if PLAN_REVISION_REQUIRED)
None.

## Plan Review: Sprint 19 - Callee Verification (Phase 12)

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Spec Compliance
The plan captures the major §5B steps (dialog matching, issuer match, TN rights, goal overlap) and reuses existing components appropriately. However, several spec‑mandated elements are either mis-modeled or treated as optional in a way that conflicts with §5.2 callee verification requirements.

### Design Assessment
Separating callee verification into `verify_callee.py` is reasonable, and the reuse matrix is sensible. The claim tree is clear, but brand/goal overlap are marked OPTIONAL regardless of presence, which risks suppressing required failures. The new request model for callee introduces `caller_passport_jwt` cleanly for goal overlap.

### Open Questions Resolution
The plan’s answers for call-id/cseq requirements, goal overlap, and callee TN rights align with draft‑04 §5.2 at a high level. The SIP evidence transport note is correctly marked as out of scope.

### Findings
- [High]: Brand/goal claims are marked OPTIONAL in the claim tree even when `card`/`goal` are present. §5B steps indicate these checks are required when the claims are present; they should be REQUIRED children when present, mirroring caller behavior.
- [Medium]: `DIALOG_MISMATCH` and `ISSUER_MISMATCH` are assumed to exist in §4.2A, but they are not currently in the error registry. The plan must either add them to `ErrorCode` or map to existing codes and document the mapping.
- [Medium]: `context.sip.cseq` is required for callee verification, but the current `SipContext` model defines `cseq` as optional. The plan should include explicit validation (or a callee‑specific context model) that enforces presence of both `call_id` and `cseq` for the callee endpoint.

### Required Changes (if CHANGES_REQUESTED)
1. Make `brand_verified` and `goal_overlap_verified` REQUIRED when the corresponding `card`/`goal` claims are present, with failure propagation per §3.3A.
2. Add `DIALOG_MISMATCH` and `ISSUER_MISMATCH` to the error registry (or document a strict mapping to existing codes), and update tests accordingly.
3. Enforce required `call_id` and `cseq` for callee requests (via model or explicit validation).

### Recommendations
- Consider reusing `authorization.py` TN validation with a callee‑specific binding helper to avoid divergence.
- Add tests that cover multiple DEs/APE in dossier and ensure issuer match uses the callee’s kid, not the caller’s.

## Plan Review: Sprint 19 (Revision 2)

**Verdict:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

### Sprint 19 Plan Issues (from Revision 1)
- [High] Brand/goal conditional REQUIRED: FIXED
- [Medium] Error code registry: FIXED
- [Medium] Callee SIP context validation: FIXED

### Sprint 18 Code Fixes (Part A)
- [High] CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED: Needs clarification
- [Medium] SIP_TIMING_TOLERANCE_SECONDS: Needs clarification
- [Medium] DE selection by signer: Properly specified

### Additional Findings
- [High]: The Part A fix for `verify_sip_context_alignment()` changes its return type to a tuple of `(ClaimStatus, reasons, evidence)`, but the current system expects a ClaimBuilder. This will cause integration drift unless you also plan to refactor the caller path. Specify how the new signature integrates with existing claim construction, or keep the ClaimBuilder pattern and just pass config into it. `~/.claude/plans/sequential-meandering-truffle.md`.
- [High]: The plan requires `context.sip.call_id`, but `SipContext` currently has no `call_id` field. You need to add it to the model (and ensure it’s populated in requests), or adjust validation to use a different field name. `app/vvp/api_models.py`.
- [Medium]: The Test Strategy section still says “Brand and goal overlap as OPTIONAL claims,” which contradicts the revised conditional‑REQUIRED semantics. Update the test plan wording to reflect required‑when‑present behavior.

### Required Changes (if CHANGES_REQUESTED)
1. Clarify/adjust the `verify_sip_context_alignment()` signature so it remains compatible with the existing ClaimBuilder flow, or explicitly plan the refactor and its call‑sites.
2. Add `call_id` to `SipContext` (or document a different field) and update the validation/tests accordingly.
3. Align the test strategy language with the conditional REQUIRED semantics for brand/goal overlap.

### Recommendations
- Consider making callee‑specific validation reuse the same SIP alignment function to avoid divergent behavior between caller/callee paths.

## Plan Review: Sprint 19 (Revision 3)

**Verdict:** APPROVED

### Revision 2 Findings Resolution
- [High] ClaimBuilder return type: RESOLVED
- [High] call_id location: RESOLVED
- [Medium] Test Strategy wording: RESOLVED

### Additional Findings
None.

### Recommendations
- Keep the SIP alignment helper signature aligned between caller and callee to avoid divergence.

## Code Review: Sprint 19 - Callee Verification + Sprint 18 Fixes

Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED

Part A: Sprint 18 Fixes Assessment
A1 (CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED): Plumbed correctly; `verify_sip_context_alignment()` now takes `context_required` and `verify.py` passes config.
A2 (SIP_TIMING_TOLERANCE_SECONDS): Plumbed correctly; `verify.py` passes `SIP_TIMING_TOLERANCE_SECONDS`.
A3 (DE selection by signer): Implemented via `_find_signer_de_credential()` and used for brand/goal checks.

Part B: Phase 12 Implementation Assessment
Dialog matching (§5B Step 1): Implemented with call-id/cseq checks and DIALOG_MISMATCH error mapping.
Issuer verification (§5B Step 9): Implemented using dossier root issuer vs kid AID with ISSUER_MISMATCH mapping.
Goal overlap (§5B Step 14): Implemented with hierarchical subset logic and conditional claim omission.
Endpoint validation: Enforces call_id and sip.cseq presence for callee requests.

Code Quality
Modules are readable and consistent with existing patterns. Error conversion and claim builders follow the project conventions.

Test Coverage
Dialog matching, issuer matching, goal overlap, and endpoint validation are covered. There is no direct unit coverage for callee TN rights logic or for the new claim tree requirements (timing/signature children), so regressions there are possible.

Findings
- [High]: Callee TN rights validation is not bound to the accountable party and uses ad‑hoc matching (string equality / last‑10‑digits), bypassing `tn_utils` allocation parsing and issuee binding. This can incorrectly accept rights and does not reflect the authorization logic used elsewhere. `app/vvp/verify_callee.py` (`validate_callee_tn_rights`).
- [High]: The callee claim tree omits required `timing_valid` and `signature_valid` children under `passport_verified` and omits structure/acdc signature children under `dossier_verified`, diverging from the approved plan’s claim tree. This affects status propagation and traceability. `app/vvp/verify_callee.py` (claim construction).
- [Medium]: `validate_callee_tn_rights()` does not validate E.164 formats or TNAlloc ranges and ignores DNO semantics beyond a comment. This should reuse `tn_utils` for consistency and correctness. `app/vvp/verify_callee.py`.

Required Changes (if not APPROVED)
1. Rework callee TN rights to reuse `tn_utils` allocation parsing and bind rights to the accountable party (APE issuee) or a verified delegation chain, not just the signer AID.
2. Align the callee claim tree with the approved plan by adding required `timing_valid` and `signature_valid` (and dossier structure/signature) nodes or update the plan accordingly and adjust propagation/tests.
